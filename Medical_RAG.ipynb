With the help of Belgian Red Cross Centre for Evidence Practice (CEBaP), Belgian Red Cross- Flanders and a multi-disciplinary expert panel, Indian Red Cross Society prepared the evidence-based Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG) in 2014 which were used to update the sixth edition of first aid Manual prepared for the general public by the St. John Ambulance (India) and the Indian Red Cross Society.\\n\\nFirst aid has been practised in the world since antiquity. There is enough evidence that it was used to give relief to the injured and sick persons in wars and calamities in India since the times of Mahabarata. The use of first aid techniques expanded and improved with time, but it got the real fillip when the Red Cross Movement started in the world about 150 years ago. Consequently, The Indian Red Cross Society was established in 1920 through an Act of the Parliament. Until then, the St. John Ambulance carried out Red Cross work in addition to its normal activities.\\n\\nTo provide the right and effective help before a trained health worker is available or the victim reaches a health facility, it needs to be given by the laypersons who happen to be present wherever a person suffers from an injury or illness. This will only be possible when a large number of laypeople are trained in evidence-based first aid techniques. Presently, about 6 lakh persons are trained in India every year in the basic first aid. The number looks impressive, but is not adequate considering the huge population and vast area not having good communication facilities.\\n\\nThis seventh edition of the Indian First Aid Manual (IFAM) has several new and updated features. A brief on anatomy and physiology has been provided on each system. The chapter on cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been completely revised. More emphasis has been put on chest compression to ensure improvement in the blood supply to heart and brain, and use of direct pressure to the site of bleeding to control further bleeding. A chapter on handwashing has been added to prevent the transmission of infections between the victim and first aiders. Guidelines related to snake bites have been totally revised considering the after effects of tourniquet binding. Useful guidelines have been added for important public health problems such as diarrhoea, fever, diabetes, emergency childbirth etc. which still claim many lives.\\n\\nI hope, the new Manual will be immensely useful for the laypersons as well as healthcare workers to understand the evidence-based techniques of first aid which are becoming more and more crucial in saving life in this era when the country is facing an epidemic of roadside accidents.\\n\\nDr. S.P.Agarwal\\n\\nSecretary General\\n\\nIndian Red Cross Society &\\n\\nSt. John Ambulance (India)\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n9\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nWe are very thankful to the many experts in the medical and first aid training profession who contributed their knowledge and experience to this manual.\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SPONSOR:\\n\\nDr S.P.

Being laymen in the field of medicine, it is expected that they will practice the basic principles of first aid and render such aid needed by the casualty (casualties) till medical aid arrives or the person(s) has (have) been transported to the hospital. The basic characteristic of this manual is to make the layman fully competent practically in the subject.\\n\\nThe first aid guidelines in this manual have been based on the latest available and accessible scientific and medical knowledge. In 2014, a team of Indian medical and first aid specialists publicised the Indian First Aid Guidelines (IFAG). These guidelines are developed using a rigorous and transparent methodology to overcome potential biases; are based on extensive research, data analysis and reviews; and are specifically adapted to be implemented within the Indian context. These guidelines are further complemented by the 2015 guidelines on resuscitation and first aid as published by International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The editorial board reviewed the applicability of available first aid guidelines into the specific Indian context and rephrased or adapted them accordingly. For interventions were neither IFAG nor international first aid guidelines existed, or in case sufficient or scientifically evidence was not available, the editorial board decided to include the commonly applied first aid practices.\\n\\nIn the first chapter, this manual specifies in detail what “first aid” is about and how to deal with an emergency. It further includes basic first aid techniques the first aider should master, i.e. observing vital signs and consciousness; cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); recovery position, the first assessment of a casualty; and handwashing.\\n\\nThe subsequent chapters describe a more in-depth first aid approach and techniques.\\n\\nThe structure of these chapters is:\\n\\n(cid:1) Each chapter begins with a short overview of the anatomy and physiology.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFor specific situation or condition, a list of signs and symptoms a lay person may observe and recognize are included in the section ‘What do I see and enquire?’\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThis section is immediately followed by ‘What do I do?’ listing a sequence of first aid guidelines and techniques appropriate for that situation or condition. Drawings support the student/reader in understanding specific positions, techniques or signs.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe list of guidelines and techniques is completed with a section on ‘When to refer the casualty to a healthcare facility?’ Please note all casualties should best consult a medical caregiver in all cases. If (urgent) patient transport is required, this is indicated by . If the casualty normally does not require organized (ambulance) transport for further treatment, it is marked with the sign . However, depending on the specific situation, condition of the person and severity of the injury or sickness, (ambulance) transport or even urgent transport might be required: the first aider needs to consider all elements on when and how a casualty needs to seek further medical help. In case of doubt, it is always better to arrange (urgent) transport to the healthcare facility for further medical treatment.\\n\\nImportant remarks are highlighted in grey text box and preceded with a sign. Supplemental information is marked with and printed in a smaller font.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n12\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe contents of a first aid box are listed at the last few pages of the manual.\\n\\nThroughout the manual we opted to use the terms ‘injured person’, ‘casualty’ or simply ‘the person’ as a person who got injured or even killed by some event. If the reason is a disease or illness, the term ‘sick person’ is used.\\n\\nThe guidelines and instructions are intended to be applied on both male and female casualties. To make the reading easier, and instead of writing ‘he/she’, we opted to use the pronoun ‘he’ meaning that the guideline or instruction is applicable both for male and female victims. Only if the intervention is specifically applicable to females, we use ‘she’ in the instructions.\\n\\nThis manual is limited in describing the guidelines, interventions and techniques in words and pictures only. To acquire a practical knowledge, it is important to practice the specific techniques, i.e. basic first aid techniques e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), how to put a person into recovery position, etc. First aid course organized by the Indian Red Cross Society and the St John Ambulance Association India are ideal opportunities in achieving a clear insight in the techniques and allows to exercise the theory into practice via simulation and on dummies.\\n\\nIt is advised the trained first aider to refresh their first aid knowledge by reviewing the guidelines and techniques regularly in this manual and to practice them very frequently.\\n\\nThe medical science is constantly in evolution. Newer scientific insights might have an influence on the approach of casualties by lay people and on the first aid guidelines and techniques. This manual is scheduled to be reviewed and updated every five years; the next review is scheduled in 2021.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n13\\n\\nA.\\n\\nBASIC FIRST AID TECHNIQUES\\n\\nIn this chapter you will learn about:\\n\\n(cid:1) Aims of first aid.\\n\\n(cid:1) First aid and the law.\\n\\n(cid:1) Dealing with an emergency.\\n\\n(cid:1) Resuscitation (basic CPR).\\n\\n(cid:1) Recovery position.\\n\\n(cid:1) Initial top to toe assessment.\\n\\n(cid:1) Hygiene and hand washing.\\n\\n(cid:1) First aid overview flow chart.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n14\\n\\nA.1\\n\\nAIMS OF FIRST AID\\n\\nFirst aid is the first assistance or treatment given to a casualty or a sick person for any injury or sudden illness before the arrival of an ambulance, the arrival of a qualified paramedical or medical person or before arriving at a facility that can provide professional medical care.\\n\\nAs a consequence of disaster or civil strife people suffer injuries which requires urgent care and transportation to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nA.1.1\\n\\nAIMS OF FIRST AID\\n\\nThe aims of first aid are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nto preserve life,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nto prevent the worsening of one’s medical condition,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nto promote recovery, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nto help to ensure safe transportation to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nA.1.2\\n\\nTHE FIRST AIDER\\n\\nA first aider is the term describing any person who has received a certificate from an authorised training body indicating that he or she is qualified to render first aid.\\n\\nFirst aid certifications issued by St. John Ambulance Association and the Indian Red Cross Society are awarded to candidates who have attended a course of theoretical and practical work and who have passed a professionally supervised examination.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n15\\n\\nA.2\\n\\nFIRST AID AND THE LAW\\n\\nA.2.1\\n\\nINDIAN GOOD SAMARITAN PROTECTION GUIDELINES\\n\\nA Good Samaritan in legal terms refers to “someone who renders aid in an emergency to an injured person on a voluntary basis”.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has published the Indian Good Samaritan and Bystanders Protection Guidelines in The Gazette of India in May 2015 (Notification No 25035/101/2014-RS dated 12 May 2015). The guidelines are to be followed by hospitals, police and other authorities for the protection of Good Samaritans.\\n\\nFollowing guidelines are included (sub-selection of the guidelines):\\n\\n1. A bystander or Good Samaritan, including an eyewitness of a road accident may take an injured to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. The eyewitness has to provide his address. No questions are to be asked.\\n\\n2. The bystander or Good Samaritan shall not be liable for any civil and criminal liability.\\n\\n3. A bystander or Good Samaritan who makes a phone call to inform the police or emergency services for the person lying injured on the road cannot be compelled to give his name or personal details on the phone or in person. The disclosure of contact details of the Good Samaritan is to be voluntary.\\n\\n4. The lack of response by a (medical) doctor in an emergency pertaining to road accidents (where he is expected to provide care) shall constitute ‘Professional Misconduct’.\\n\\nA.2.2\\n\\nDUTY OF GIVING CARE\\n\\nUsually, if a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.\\n\\nIn relation to the “duty of giving care”, there is currently (2015) no legal obligation for first aiders to provide first aid in a general public context, not unless it\\'s part of a job description. First aid officers in workplaces and school teachers have a duty of care.\\n\\nOnce a first aider begins to provide first aid, a duty of care is established and the first aider then has an obligation to fulfil the duty of care.\\n\\nIf a road user is involved in an accident, there is a legal requirement to stay at the scene, assist the injured and report the incident to the police.\\n\\nNot fulfilling a duty of giving care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence. Whilst there is no law that forces anyone to treat a casualty this does not mean that one can simply leave a casualty who you know is in danger. To do so may make you liable through your omission to act. If you are not happy to provide first aid there are several things you can and should do including (but not limited to):\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ninform someone else, such as the police or the emergency services;\\n\\n(cid:1) make the area around the casualty safe for yourself, others and the casualty;\\n\\n(cid:1) monitor the casualty and/or find out what happened; and\\n\\n(cid:1) comfort the casualty.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n16\\n\\nA.2.3\\n\\nCONSENT OF THE PERSON IN NEED\\n\\nA conscious person has the right to either refuse or accept care. If the person is conscious, you must ask for his consent before commencing any first aid. If he refuses your help, stay nearby and call the police and emergency services, who can then deal with the situation.\\n\\nIf the person is under 18, it is best to obtain consent from his parent or guardian if they are present. If they refuse your help, stay nearby and call the police and the emergency services, who can then deal with the situation.\\n\\nIf the person is unconscious or unable to formally consent, his consent is inferred and you can then give the necessary first aid.\\n\\nA.2.4\\n\\nPRIVACY\\n\\nIn any first aid situation, the first aider must take steps to assist the person to maintain personal privacy. This means things like, keeping crowds away, putting up a screen if necessary, and covering any exposed body parts with blankets, or sheets, if available.\\n\\nThe first aider also needs to take steps to maintain confidentiality. This means not talking about the incident to other people, or answering questions from the media, unless you have permission from the person involved in the accident.\\n\\nA.2.5\\n\\nNEGLIGENCE\\n\\nIf a volunteer comes to the aid of an injured or sick person who is a stranger, the person giving the aid owes the stranger a duty of being reasonably careful.\\n\\nNot fulfilling, or breaking a duty of care leaves the first aider open to questions of negligence. It is unlikely that a first aider would be sued as long as not practiced outside the parameters of the techniques taught at the first aid training.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n17\\n\\nA.3\\n\\nDEALING WITH AN EMERGENCY\\n\\nEmergency situations vary greatly but there are four main steps that always apply:\\n\\n1. Make the area safe.\\n\\n2. Evaluate the injured person’s condition.\\n\\n3. Seek help.\\n\\n4. Give first aid.\\n\\nA.3.1\\n\\nSTEP 1: MAKE THE AREA SAFE\\n\\nYour own safety should always come first.\\n\\nAs a first aider, you should:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntry to find out what has just happened;\\n\\n(cid:1) check for any danger: is there a threat from traffic, fire, electricity cables, etc.;\\n\\n(cid:1) never approach the scene of an accident if you are putting yourself in danger;\\n\\n(cid:1) do your best to protect both the injured person(s) and other people on the scene;\\n\\n(cid:1) be aware that the property of the injured person is at risk. Theft can occur. So mind\\n\\nyour safety, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nseek police or emergency help if an accident scene is unsafe and you cannot offer help without putting yourself in danger.\\n\\nAn important part of safety also includes washing your hands and wearing gloves or a protection when coming in contact with the injured or sick person’s blood or body fluids.\\n\\nIn case of road accidents, as a first aider, you should:\\n\\n(cid:1) always follow the traffic rules;\\n\\n(cid:1) ask other people to warn traffic about the event;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nif possible, place a warning sign at a good distance, at least 30 meters to either side of the accident, to warn traffic. Do not forget to remove the warning signs afterwards;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nseek help from the police or emergency services;\\n\\n(cid:1) not allow anybody to smoke near an accident site;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswitch off the engine of every car involved in the accident; and\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n18\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntry to apply the handbrake of vehicles involved in the accident to prevent them from moving. You can also put something against the tyres to prevent rolling.\\n\\nAs a general rule, the injured person should not be moved from the scene of an accident. Any movement may make the injury worse if there has been a head, neck, back, and leg or arm injury.\\n\\nOnly move injured people if:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person is in more danger if he is left there,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe situation cannot be made safe,\\n\\n(cid:1) medical help will not arrive soon, and\\n\\n(cid:1) you can do so without putting yourself in danger.\\n\\nA.3.2\\n\\nSTEP 2: EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE SICK OR INJURED PERSON\\n\\nIf it is safe, you can evaluate the sick or injured person’s condition. Always check that he is conscious and breathing normally. Situations in which consciousness or breathing are impaired are often life threatening.\\n\\nBleeding can also happen inside the body and can be life-threatening although the loss of blood is not seen.\\n\\nTechniques of resuscitation (CPR), the recovery position, etc. are explained in this manual.\\n\\nA.3.3\\n\\nSTEP 3: SEEK HELP\\n\\nOnce you have evaluated the sick or injured person’s condition you can decide if help is needed urgently.\\n\\nIf help is needed, ask a bystander to call for help. Ask him to come back and confirm that help is underway.\\n\\nIf you call for help, be prepared to have the following information available:\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n19\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe location where the help is required (address, street, specific reference points, location; if in a building: floor, room);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe telephone or mobile number you are calling from;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe nature of the problem;\\n\\n(cid:1) what happened (car accident, fall, sudden illness, explosion, …);\\n\\n(cid:1) how many injured;\\n\\n(cid:1) nature of the injuries (if you know);\\n\\n(cid:1) what type of help is needed:\\n\\n(cid:1) ambulance,\\n\\n(cid:1) police,\\n\\n(cid:1) fire brigade, or\\n\\n(cid:1) other services;\\n\\n(cid:1) and any other information that might help.\\n\\nYou might be asked to give your name. Always stay calm and answer their questions calmly. The call takers are professionals and will give you further guidance.\\n\\nIf an ambulance can be obtained in a short time, it is best to call for one and use it to transport the injured or sick person to the healthcare facility. An ambulance is the best way to transport ill or injured persons, but they are not always and everywhere quickly available.\\n\\nYou can always ask the police for help.\\n\\nIf no help is available, you will have to arrange transport yourself (in a van, a truck, a car, an auto-rickshaw, a motorbike, a scooter, a bike-rickshaw, a bike...). Always move the sick or injured person with great care.\\n\\nA.3.4\\n\\nSTEP 4: PROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\nGive first aid in accordance with the instructions given in the following chapters in this manual. When providing first aid, try to protect an ill or injured person from cold and heat.\\n\\nDo not give anything to eat or drink to a person who is:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nseverely injured,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeeling nausea,\\n\\n(cid:1) becoming sleepy, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfalling unconscious.\\n\\nIn fact, as a general principle, the rule is not to give a casualty anything to drink or eat. Important exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycaemic shock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient), diarrhoea and fever leading to dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke. The details can be reviewed in the specific chapters on these conditions.\\n\\nBe aware that experiencing an emergency situation is a very stressful experience for the injured or sick person.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n20\\n\\nTo support him through the ordeal, follow these simple tips:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntell the sick or injured person your name, explain how you are going to help him and reassure him. This will help to relax him;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlisten to the person and show concern and kindness;\\n\\n(cid:1) make him as comfortable as possible;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nif he is worried, tell him that it is normal to be afraid;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nif it is safe to do so, encourage family and loved ones to stay with him; and\\n\\n(cid:1) explain to the sick or injured person what has happened and what is going to happen.\\n\\nA.3.5 WHEN CAN I STOP PROVIDING FIRST AID?\\n\\nThe question arises when your first aid ‘duty’ comes to an end?\\n\\nWithin first aid, CPR is a lifesaving activity. But when you can stop giving CPR? There are four reasons allowing you to stop CPR:\\n\\n(cid:1) you see a sign of life, such as breathing;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsomeone trained in first aid or a medical professional takes over;\\n\\n(cid:1) you are too exhausted to continue; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n21\\n\\nA.4\\n\\nSTRESS WHEN GIVING FIRST AID\\n\\nIt is only normal to feel stress if you are suddenly faced with the need to give first aid in a real emergency.\\n\\nTry to bring your emotions under control before you proceed. You may take some time to stand back from the situation and regain your calm. Do not set about the task too hastily and do not under any circumstances place your own safety at risk.\\n\\nIt is not always easy to process a traumatic event emotionally. It is not unusual for first aiders to experience difficulty when working through their emotions afterwards. Talk to your friends, family, fellow first aiders or someone else. If you are still worried, talk to a professional and seek counselling.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n22\\n\\nA.5\\n\\nRESUSCITATION (BASIC CPR)\\n\\nReviving someone who is unconscious and/or not breathing or not breathing normally is called resuscitation.\\n\\nIf the victim is not breathing or is not breathing normally, any source of suffocation should be removed and resuscitation is to be started.\\n\\nChest compressions with or without rescue breathings are performed by an individual during cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an attempt to restore spontaneous circulation.\\n\\nFor untrained or minimally trained first aid providers treating an adult victim, compression-only CPR is recommended. These chest compressions ensure a small but crucial supply of blood to the heart and brain.\\n\\nFor formally trained first aid providers (and professionals) treating an adult victim, compression with breaths is recommended. If the trained first aid provider is unable or unwilling, or in any other circumstance, compression-only CPR may be substituted for compression with breaths.\\n\\nFor babies and children under one year, compressions with breaths are always recommended.\\n\\nA.5.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nIn case of a cardiac arrest (heart stops functioning) you might notice the following signs:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsudden collapse,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nloss of consciousness,\\n\\n(cid:1) no breathing,\\n\\n(cid:1) no pulse (however this is not always easy for laypeople to confirm).\\n\\nA.5.1.1\\n\\nHOW TO OBSERVE RESPONSIVENESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS?\\n\\nUnconsciousness occurs when a person is suddenly unable to respond to stimuli like sound or pain, and appears to be asleep. A person may be unconscious for a few seconds (as is the case with fainting) or for longer periods of time.\\n\\nPeople who become unconscious do not respond to loud sounds or shaking. They may even stop breathing or their pulse may become faint. This calls for immediate emergency attention. The sooner the person receives emergency first aid, the better it is.\\n\\nThe AVPU scale (an acronym from \"alert, voice, pain, unresponsiveness\") is a system by which a first aider can measure and record a patient\\'s responsiveness, indicating the level of consciousness. It is based on the casualty’s eye opening, verbal and movement (motor) responses.\\n\\nThe AVPU scale has only four possible outcomes:\\n\\n(cid:1) A – Alert.\\n\\nThe person is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). The person will spontaneously open eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor function.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n23\\n\\n(cid:1) V – Responding to voice.\\n\\nThe person makes some kind of response when you talk to him. It could be opening his eyes, responding to your questions or initiating a move. These responses could be as little as a grunt, moan, or slight movement of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer.\\n\\n(cid:1) P – Responding to pain.\\n\\nThe patient makes a response of any kind on the application of pain stimulus, such as a central pain stimulus like a rub on his breastbone or a peripheral stimulus such as squeezing his fingers.\\n\\nPatients with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require any pain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their body (including abnormal posturing).\\n\\n(cid:1) U - Unresponsiveness also noted as \\'Unconsciousness\\'.\\n\\nThis outcome is recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to voice or pain.\\n\\nTo check a person’s responsiveness/consciousness state check the following:\\n\\n1. A person who looks around, speaks, responds clearly to questions, feels touch and moves or walks around, is considered alert (A).\\n\\n2. The person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions:\\n\\n(cid:1) “What is your name?”\\n\\n(cid:1) “Where do you live?”\\n\\n(cid:1) “How old are you?”\\n\\nThe person responds to simple commands:\\n\\n(cid:1) “Squeeze my hand.”\\n\\n(cid:1) “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.”\\n\\nIf the person responds, he is responsive to voice (V).\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf there is still no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves.\\n\\nIf the person responds to pain, he is responsive to pain (P)\\n\\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state (U).\\n\\nNote that a person might only partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, touch, pain) and might be in an in-between (groggy) state.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n24\\n\\nChecking if a casualty is conscious or unconscious should only take a few seconds and should not delay checking for the breathing.\\n\\nMore information on unconsciousness is given in the respective chapter.\\n\\nA.5.1.2\\n\\nHOW TO OBSERVE THE BREATHING?\\n\\nThe airway may be narrowed or blocked making breathing noisy or impossible. Reasons for blockage may be:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLoss of muscular control in the throat may allow the tongue to sag back and block the air passage.\\n\\n(cid:1) When the reflexes are impaired, saliva may lie in the back of the throat, blocking\\n\\nthe airway.\\n\\n(cid:1) Any foreign body in the throat may block the air passage e.g. vomit, blood,\\n\\ndentures etc.\\n\\nIt is essential to establish a clear airway immediately. Unless you can clearly see that the person is breathing normally, an unconscious person must be turned onto his back to unblock the breathing passage and to check for breathing. Unblocking the breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury.\\n\\nTo observe the breathing do following:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIf the person is unconscious and is not on his back, turn him on to his back.\\n\\n2. Kneel beside the casualty.\\n\\n3. Lift the chin forwards with the index and middle fingers of one hand while pressing the forehead backwards with the palm of the other hand. This manoeuvre will lift the tongue forward and clear the airways.\\n\\n4. Observe breathing by listening, feeling and looking\\n\\n5. After opening the victim\\'s airway, check to see if the victim is breathing.\\n\\nTo do this, place your cheek in front of the victim\\'s mouth (about 3-5 cm away) while looking down his chest (towards his feet).\\n\\nIf desired, you can also gently place a hand on the center of the victim\\'s chest. This allows you to observe whether the victim is breathing in the following ways:\\n\\na. look for chest/abdominal movement,\\n\\nb. listen to breathing sounds,\\n\\nc. feel the air coming out of the nose or mouth.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n25\\n\\nIn the first minutes after cardiac arrest it often appears as if the person is trying to breathe. It can appear as if the person is barely breathing or is taking infrequent noisy gasps. It is important not to confuse this with normal breathing and you should start resuscitation immediately.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf the casualty’s chest still fails to rise, first assume that the airway is not fully open. Once the airway is cleared the casualty may begin breathing spontaneously.\\n\\nElse, clear the airway by removing any visible item that is blocking the airway:\\n\\na. Hook your first two fingers covered with clean cloth/gloves.\\n\\nb. Sweep round inside the mouth/ throat.\\n\\nc. Check again the breathing.\\n\\nOne should not spend time searching for hidden obstructions. Care should be taken not to push any object further down the throat.\\n\\nBe careful: do not put your fingers in somebody’s closed mouth.\\n\\nMore information on the breathing can be found in the respective chapter.\\n\\nA.5.1.3\\n\\nHOW TO OBSERVE THE PULSE?\\n\\nFeeling the pulse is not always easy. Feeling the pulse during an emergency at the wrist is often unreliable.\\n\\nThe pulse can be felt by placing the finger tips gently on the voice box and sliding them down into the hollow between the voice box and the adjoining muscle.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n26\\n\\nDo not loose time trying to locate and feel the pulse. The current resuscitation guidelines for laypeople direct that resuscitation (CPR) is to be started when the person is not breathing or not breathing normally and does not require to check the pulse.\\n\\nMore information on the pulse can be found in the respective chapter.\\n\\nA.5.2\\n\\nRESUSCITATION OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING NORMALLY\\n\\nA.5.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person who needs help and bystanders before giving help.\\n\\n2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. SECURE AN OPEN AIRWAY\\n\\n2. The person urgently needs help.

Turn the casualty on his back on a hard surface, if not already.\\n\\n2. Kneel next to the casualty, beside his upper arm.\\n\\n3. Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person’s chest.\\n\\n4. Place the heel of the other hand on top of your first hand.\\n\\nIf the person’s age is below puberty, only use one hand.\\n\\nIf the victim is a baby, do not use this technique but apply the technique of CPR for babies and children under the age of one year.\\n\\n5. Lock your fingers of both hands together.\\n\\nDo not apply pressure to the person’s ribs. Nor should you press the upper part of the stomach or the bottom end of the breast bone.\\n\\n6. Make sure your shoulders are directly above the person’s chest.\\n\\n7. With outstretched arms, push five to maximum six centimetres downwards.\\n\\n8. Release the pressure and avoid leaning on the chest between compressions to allow full chest recoil. The compression and release should be of equal duration.\\n\\nEach time you press down allow the chest to rise fully again. This will let blood flow back to the heart.\\n\\n9. Do not allow your hands to shift or come away from the breastbone.\\n\\n10. Give 30 chest compressions in this way at a rate of 100 compressions a minute (you may go faster, but not more than 120 compressions a minute). This equates to just fewer than two compressions a second.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n28\\n\\nA.5.2.4 CPR: HOW TO GIVE RESCUE BREATHS?\\n\\nIf for some reason you cannot or do not want to give rescue breaths, you can just continue giving chest compressions (five to maximum six centimetre deep at a rate of 100 compressions a minute).\\n\\n1. Put one hand on the person’s forehead and tilt back his head.\\n\\n2. Put your other hand on the bony part of the chin and lift the chin.\\n\\n3. Then pinch the person’s nose with one hand that is on his forehead.\\n\\n5. Take a normal breath and then put your mouth completely over the person’s mouth and seal with your lips. Calmly blow your air into the mouth of the person’s for one second. Check if the person’s chest rises. If the chest does not rise, take the following steps:\\n\\na. Check if anything is in the person’s mouth.\\n\\nIf so, remove any visible items that may block the airway.\\n\\nb. Check that the head is well tilted and the chin is lifted properly.\\n\\nIn any case, make no more than two attempts to blow air into the person.\\n\\n7. Start another series of 30 chest compressions prior to trying to blow air into the person’s mouth again.\\n\\nChest compressions and rescue breaths are tiring to administer. If there are a few trained rescuers present, it is best to alternate with each other.\\n\\nTo ensure that the quality of the chest compressions remains optimal, the rescuers should switch every two minutes:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe first rescuer gives 30 chest compressions followed by two ventilations and another set of 30 chest compressions and two ventilations.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThen another rescuer takes over and repeats the above steps and switch again.\\n\\nThe switches should happen with minimal interruption and as quickly and smoothly as possible.\\n\\n8. Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n29\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe victim starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally;\\n\\n(cid:1) help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over;\\n\\n(cid:1) you become too exhausted to continue; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe area becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nA.5.2.5\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nWash your hands after taking care of the person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nA.5.3\\n\\nRESUSCITATION OF BABY/CHILD (LESS THAN ONE YEAR OLD) WHO IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING NORMALLY\\n\\nA.5.3.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

Cover the baby’s/child’s nose and mouth with your mouth and gently puff into his lungs only until you see his chest rise, pausing between rescue breaths to let the air flow back out.\\n\\nRemember that a baby’s lungs are much smaller than yours, so it takes much less than a full breath to fill them.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n31\\n\\n3. Check if the baby’s/child’s chest rises.\\n\\nIf the chest does not rise, take following steps:\\n\\na. Check if anything is in the baby’s/child’s mouth.\\n\\nIf so, remove any visible items that may block the airway.\\n\\nb. Check that the head is well tilted and the chin is lifted properly.\\n\\nIn any case: make no more than two attempts to blow air into the baby/child.\\n\\n4. Start another series of 30 chest compressions prior trying to puff air into the baby’s/child’s mouth again.\\n\\n5. Do not interrupt the resuscitation until:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe child starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally;\\n\\n(cid:1) help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe area becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nA.5.3.5\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nAlways wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nA.5.4 WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways – urgently: Any person that has stopped breathing or needed CPR should always be transported to the nearest healthcare facility as quickly as possible continuing CPR.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n32\\n\\nA.6\\n\\nRECOVERY POSITION\\n\\nThe recovery position refers to a lateral prone position of the body, in to which an unconscious but breathing normally casualty can be placed as part of the first aid treatment.\\n\\nIn an unconscious person, the muscles are relaxed. This causes the tongue to obstruct the airway. This risk can be eliminated by carefully tilting the head back and lifting the chin. The recovery position should be used for unconscious casualties who are breathing.\\n\\nThe position of the casualty’s arms and legs provide the necessary stability to keep the body in a safe and comfortable position.\\n\\nUnblocking the breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury. Unless you can clearly see that the person is breathing normally, an unconscious person must be turned onto his back to unblock the breathing passage and to check breathing.\\n\\nA.6.1\\n\\nHOW TO PUT A PERSON INTO THE RECOVERY POSITION?\\n\\nA.6.1.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

If the condition of the casualty worsens during the examination, the necessary first aid measures should be taken immediately.\\n\\nDuring assessment, movement should be as little as possible to avoid further injuries.\\n\\nAssess from head toward feet and compare one side of the casualty’s body with the other as this helps you to detect any swelling or irregularities that require first aid.\\n\\nCheck consciousness\\n\\nCheck breathing\\n\\nCheck pulse\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n38\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\nCheck head injuries\\n\\nCheck eyes\\n\\nCheck mouth\\n\\nCheck ears\\n\\n39\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\nCheck neck\\n\\nCheck chest\\n\\nCheck arms\\n\\nCheck abdomen\\n\\n40\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\nCheck hips/groin\\n\\nCheck legs\\n\\n41\\n\\nA.8\\n\\nHYGIENE AND HAND WASHING\\n\\nA.8.1\\n\\nGENERAL HYGIENE NOTES\\n\\nWhen dealing with ill or injured persons it is important to keep the risk of infection between yourself and the sick or injured person to a minimum:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf possible, wash your hands with soap and water (40-60 seconds) before and definitely after you take care of an ill or injured person. Alternatively, you can also use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can also be used, if the hands are not visibly soiled (20-30 seconds).\\n\\n(cid:1) Avoid direct contact with blood or body fluids.\\n\\n(cid:1) Use gloves if there is blood or other body fluids like urine or vomit. You can also use\\n\\na clean plastic bag to cover the hands.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf no gloves or plastic bags are available you can:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInstruct the sick or injured person as to what he can do himself.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTry to avoid contact with blood or body fluids as much as possible when you give first aid.\\n\\n(cid:1) You may decide not to give help if you cannot ensure avoiding contact\\n\\nwith blood or body fluids.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIt is good to have gloves in your first aid kit.\\n\\n(cid:1) Use a sticking plaster, bandage or clean cloth to protect any cuts, grazes, or wounds you may have yourself. Infections may spread through breaks in your skin.\\n\\n(cid:1) Wear shoes to protect your feet from infection.\\n\\n(cid:1) Use lots of clean water to rinse out any blood or other body fluid that splashes into\\n\\nyour eyes or mouth, straight away.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n42\\n\\n(cid:1) Dispose of used materials appropriately and clean up any blood spills because it\\n\\ncan cause infection to others.\\n\\n(cid:1) Be very careful with sharp objects. They should be disposed of with care (e.g. in a\\n\\nbox) so that they form no danger to others.\\n\\n(cid:1) Dispose of any soiled bandages carefully. Put them in a plastic bag or bin and then\\n\\nburn or bury them.\\n\\n(cid:1) Be careful not to use dirty or contaminated materials to treat ill or injured persons\\n\\nas these can pass on diseases from one person to another.\\n\\n(cid:1) You can sterilize material by placing it for 10 minutes in boiling water or running it\\n\\nthrough a flame a few times.\\n\\n(cid:1) Use clean drinking water or boiled and cooled water if a person needs to drink.\\n\\nA.8.2\\n\\nTECHNIQUE OF HAND WASHING\\n\\n1. Wet your hands under running water.\\n\\n2. Use soap to cover all hand surfaces. If you have liquid soap, this is best. Alternatively you can also use ash that is no longer hot to wash your hands.\\n\\n3. Rub your hands firmly together (40-60 seconds) and wash your hands thoroughly. Make sure the soap touches all the parts of your hands. Do not forget the tips of your fingers, your thumbs and the skin between your fingers.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n43\\n\\n4.

Every time we breathe in, air containing oxygen enters the lungs. When we breathe out air containing waste products is removed from the lungs. In each inspiration we take approximately 500 cc of air in.\\n\\nRespiration is defined as the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within the body tissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide (a waste product) in the opposite direction.\\n\\nB.1.1\\n\\nTHE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\n\\nB.1.1.1\\n\\nTHE AIR PASSAGES\\n\\nThe air passages consist of the nose, throat (pharynx), wind pipe (trachea) and air-tubes (bronchi). The bronchi divide into minute branches (bronchioles) which end in the lung substance (alveoli).\\n\\nB.1.1.2\\n\\nTHE LUNGS\\n\\nThe lungs (two in number) are situated on the right and left sides of the chest cavity. Each lung is made up of a number of small sacs, called alveoli. The lungs are covered by a membrane called ‘pleura’ which lines the inner wall of the chest cavity.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n47\\n\\nB.1.2\\n\\nTHE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES\\n\\nThe respiratory muscles, diaphragm, intercostal and abdominal muscles help to contract and expand the lungs to facilitate the breathing.\\n\\nB.1.3\\n\\nMECHANISM OF RESPIRATION\\n\\nDuring inspiration (breathing in), the diaphragm (the muscle separating the chest from the abdominal cavity) flattens and increases the chest capacity from above downwards. The ribs move upwards and forwards increasing the capacity of the chest cavity from front to back by the action of the muscles situated between the ribs; the lungs thus expand and air enters them. This is an active process.\\n\\nDuring expiration (breathing out) the reverse process takes place. The diaphragm comes back to its original state and the ribs fall back thus forcing the air out of the lungs. This is a passive process.\\n\\nSmall blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alveoli. The exchanges of oxygen and carbon dioxide take place through the blood circulating in these capillaries. Oxygen is absorbed by the red blood corpuscles of the blood; water vapour and carbon dioxide are let out from the blood plasma into the alveoli and expelled out.\\n\\nThe lungs are also supplied with nerves which are connected to an area in the brain called respiratory centre. This centre controls the respiration.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n48\\n\\nB.2\\n\\nNO BREATHING OR DIFFICULT BREATHING\\n\\nAsphyxia is a condition in which the lungs do not get sufficient supply of air for breathing. If this continues for some minutes, the breathing and heart action stop and death occurs.\\n\\nA person can only survive a few minutes without breathing and a beating heart.\\n\\nB.2.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF NO BREATHING\\n\\nB.2.1.1\\n\\nCONDITIONS AFFECTING THE AIR PASSAGE\\n\\nFollowing reasons can cause no breathing:\\n\\nB.2.1.1.1 OBSTRUCTION OF THE AIR PASSAGE\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nforeign body inhalation- as a coin inhaled by a child or artificial tooth by an adult;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfood going down the air passage;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsea weeds, mud or water getting into air passage during drowning;\\n\\n(cid:1) bronchial asthma;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntongue falling back in an unconscious person;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling of tissues of the throat as a result of scalding (burning by steam or boiling fluids or corrosives) or allergic reactions;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ninhaling irritant gases (coal gas, motor exhaust fumes, smoke, sewer and closed granary gas or gas in a deep unused well, etc.).\\n\\nB.2.1.1.2 COMPRESSION OF THE AIR PASSAGE (USUALLY DELIBERATE, SOMETIMES ACCIDENTAL)\\n\\n(cid:1) Smothering such as covering of the face and nose of an infant or an unconscious person lying face downwards on a pillow, or having a plastic bag covering the face of the victim,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntying a rope or scarf tightly around the neck causing strangulation,\\n\\n(cid:1) hanging or throttling (applying pressure with fingers on the windpipe).\\n\\nB.2.1.2\\n\\nCONDITIONS AFFECTING THE RESPIRATORY MECHANISM\\n\\n(cid:1) Epilepsy, tetanus, rabies, etc.;\\n\\n(cid:1) nerve diseases causing paralysis of the chest wall or diaphragm;\\n\\n(cid:1) poisonous bites (e.g. snake bites like the cobra).\\n\\nB.2.1.3\\n\\nCONDITIONS AFFECTING RESPIRATORY CENTRE\\n\\n(cid:1) Overdose of morphia or similar products such as barbiturates (sleeping tablets,\\n\\n(cid:1) electric shock,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nstroke.\\n\\nB.2.1.4\\n\\nCOMPRESSION OF THE CHEST\\n\\n(cid:1) Caving in of earth or sand in mines, quarries, pits or compression by grain in a silo or\\n\\nby beams or pillars in house-collapse;\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n49\\n\\n(cid:1) crushing against a wall or a barrier or pressure in a crowd (stampede).\\n\\nB.2.1.5\\n\\nLACK OF OXYGEN AT HIGH ALTITUDES\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLow atmospheric pressure where the oxygen level in the atmospheric air is low or due to lack of acclimatization.\\n\\nB.2.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nThe signs of no breathing are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthere is no flow of air out of the nose or mouth (listen, feel the airflow); and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe chest of the victim does not move up and down.\\n\\nNote that even after breathing has stopped the heart may continue to beat for a short while. If you find a person who is not breathing or not breathing normally, you can increase his chances of staying alive by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the person’s chest and by giving rescue breaths (CPR).\\n\\nThe signs of asphyxia are:\\n\\n(cid:1) difficulty in breathing and signs of restlessness;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe rate of breathing increases;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe breaths get shorter;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe veins of the neck become swollen;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue; and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe pulse gets faster and feebler.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n50\\n\\nB.2.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN THE CASUALTY IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING NORMALLY?\\n\\nB.2.3.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

When the lungs\\' alveoli are filled with water, they cannot exchange oxygen to and from the blood.\\n\\nIn case of ‘dry drowning’ the water never reaches the lungs. Instead, breathing in water causes the vocal cords spasm that shuts off his airways, making it hard to breathe.\\n\\n‘Secondary drowning’ happens differently. The swimmer often appears fine immediately after swimming. But over time, water left in the swimmer\\'s lungs begins to cause oedema, or swelling.\\n\\nIf a casualty has been immersed in cold water, there is also the danger of hypothermia. It is important to keep the victim warm. If the casualty was diving there could be trauma to the head, neck or spine.\\n\\nB.3.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\n(cid:1) A victim is in the water and is in distress.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFollowing signs of drowning may be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1) no breathing;\\n\\n(cid:1) difficulty in breathing and signs of restlessness;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe rate of breathing increases;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe breaths get shorter;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe veins of the neck become swollen;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe pulse gets faster and feebler; and\\n\\n(cid:1) water may gush from the mouth.\\n\\nThis water is from the stomach and should be left to drain of its own accord.

It is also a sign that he still gets air through the windpipe.\\n\\nSevere choking happens when the foreign object or a local swelling blocks the airway. This is a life-threatening emergency.\\n\\nInfants and children often choke after swallowing non-edible objects such as coins, marbles, seeds, buttons or small toys.\\n\\nMost adult cases of choking occur while eating. Since choking often occurs while eating, there are usually people present near the casualty.

It acts as a pump. It is divided into four chambers. The right upper chamber called the right atrium receives impure blood from all parts of the body through blood vessels called veins.\\n\\nWhen the heart muscle contracts (the heart beats) this impure blood is passed into the right lower chamber, called right ventricle, and finally finds its way to the lungs where it is purified. During the process of purification, it gives up carbon-dioxide and takes a fresh quantity of oxygen.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n70\\n\\nThe purified blood finds its way into the left upper chamber called left atrium. It then passes to the left lower chamber, called left ventricle, and from there, in the course of the beating of the heart the purified blood is discharged into various blood vessels called arteries and capillaries which convey this purified blood for the nourishment for the body as a whole including the heart muscles. Thus each heart is in fact two pumps put together.\\n\\nC.1.2\\n\\nBLOOD PRESSURE\\n\\nThe pressure in the arteries varies with the beating of the heart. When the heart contracts the pressure in the arterial system increases; when the heart relaxes, the pressure in the arteries decreases. The pressure exerted on the main arteries is known as the blood pressure and is recorded by a blood pressure measuring instrument.\\n\\nC.1.3\\n\\nPULSE\\n\\nWith each heartbeat blood is ejected into the arterial system. Most of the arteries are placed deep in the body except on the wrist, elbow, neck, groin and ankle. So arterial pulse is normally felt over the lateral side of the wrist, in the neck, temples, and groin and near the ankle. You may not be able to feel arteries even at these sites (except carotid artery in the neck which is a major artery near to the heart) when the person is in shock. Nevertheless, feeling the pulse correctly is not always easy and requires training.\\n\\nPulse rate in a normal resting adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Tachycardia refers to the heart beating too fast at rest - over 100 beats per minute.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n71\\n\\nWrist\\n\\nNeck\\n\\nElbow\\n\\nAnkle\\n\\nC.1.4\\n\\nTHE BLOOD\\n\\nA living human body contains different types of fluids. Blood is one of them. It circulates in a closed system formed by the heart, the arteries, capillaries and the veins. An average adult has a volume of five to six litres blood which constantly circulates.\\n\\nThe blood is a thick viscid liquid of bright red or scarlet colour when it flows from the heart to the arteries and takes a dark red or purple hue when it comes back to the heart via the veins. It has a saline taste.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n72\\n\\nFigure c02 ipv C0 …Blood consists of varieties of cells:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe blood cells which carry haemoglobin (which enables the cells to carry oxygen) are red in colour and are known as red blood corpuscles (RBC).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe other cells are white blood corpuscles (WBC) (which play a role in the defence of the body against infections) and platelets (which help the blood to clot). The remainder yellowish liquid portion of the blood is called plasma which contains proteins, enzymes and other important ingredients.\\n\\n(cid:1) Whenever blood comes in contact with some external material it tends to solidify, forming a clot to stop further bleeding. When the blood clots inside the arteries, veins or the heart it is referred to as a thrombus.\\n\\nC.1.5\\n\\nHOW BLOOD CLOTS\\n\\nWhen a blood vessel is severed or damaged, it constricts (narrows) in order to prevent excessive amounts of blood from escaping. At a first stage, specialized blood cells called platelets come into contact with the damaged vessel wall, become sticky and start to clump at the site of the injury.\\n\\nInjured tissue cells at the site of the wound together with the clumped platelets, trigger a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a substance called fibrin. Strands (filaments) of fibrin come together to form a mesh, which traps blood cells to make a blood clot. The clot releases a pale-coloured fluid, called serum, which contains antibodies and specialised cells. The serum begins the process of repairing the damaged area. At first the blood clot is a jelly-like mass. Later it dries out into a crust (scab) that seals and protects the site of the wound until the healing process is complete.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n73\\n\\nC.2\\n\\nCHEST DISCOMFORT\\n\\nLike all body organs, the heart also needs blood to function properly. If someone complains of chest discomfort, it may be a sign that not enough blood is flowing to the heart muscles. This is very serious and can indicate that the person may suffer from a heart attack.\\n\\nA heart attack happens when there is a blockage of the blood flow to some parts of the heart muscle. In that case, a part of the heart muscle starts to die as soon as that region does not get any blood supply. It is serious even if the sick person says that nothing is wrong with him.\\n\\nWhen a person complains of chest pain, always suspect an impending heart attack. However, not every chest discomfort or pain is a heart attack. Several other less problematic health problems present with similar symptoms.\\n\\nDiagnosing a heart attack may not be easy, even for a trained medical staff!\\n\\nExtra alarm bells to make you consider a heart-related problem are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe pain remains longer than 15 minutes.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe pain is provoked by effort (exertion pain).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere is relief when resting.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person is known to have cardiac problems or has been prescribed cardiac medicines.\\n\\nC.2.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou might observe the following signs and symptoms when a person is having a heart attack:\\n\\n(cid:1) discomfort, tightness or pain in the chest;\\n\\n(cid:1) pain spreading to the shoulder, neck, jaw, arm or stomach;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe pain might be described as of a dull, heavy or tight character;\\n\\n(cid:1) dizziness and fainting;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsweating;\\n\\n(cid:1) difficulty in normal breathing;\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea and vomiting; or\\n\\n(cid:1) distress.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n74\\n\\nC.2.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nC.2.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

A heart attack is a life-threatening condition.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n76\\n\\nC.3\\n\\nBLEEDING\\n\\nBlood circulates in blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). When a blood vessel is damaged, several mechanisms are activated to control blood loss: the vessel constricts, and a series of chemical reactions occur to form a blood clot as a “plug” over the damaged area. If blood vessels are torn or severed, uncontrolled blood loss may occur before clotting can take place, and shock may develop.\\n\\nC.3.1\\n\\nTYPES OF BLEEDING\\n\\nA bleeding can be classified by the type of the blood vessel that has been damaged:\\n\\n(cid:1) Arterial bleeding.\\n\\nArteries carry bright red oxygen rich blood under pressure from the heart. If an artery is damaged, the bleeding may be profuse. The blood will spurt out of it in time with the heartbeat. If a main artery is severed, the blood may jet several feet high. In this case, the volume of the circulating blood will fall rapidly.\\n\\n(cid:1) Venous bleeding.\\n\\nThe blood in the veins, having given up its oxygen into the tissues, is dark red. The blood flows under less pressure than arterial blood, but the vein walls can widen greatly and the blood can ‘pool’ inside them. If a major vein is damaged, the blood may gush from it profusely.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n77\\n\\n(cid:1) Capillary bleeding.\\n\\nBleeding from the capillaries occurs with any wound. At first the bleeding may be brisk, but blood loss is usually slight. A blow may rupture capillaries under the skin, causing bleeding into the tissues (bruising).\\n\\nA bleeding can also be classified by its location:\\n\\n(cid:1) External bleeding.\\n\\nIf the bleeding is from the surface of the body, it is called an external bleeding.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInternal bleeding.\\n\\nIf the bleeding is within the skull, chest and abdomen or inside the body, it is called an internal bleeding. These bleedings might not been noticed immediately. At a later stage, blood might ooze out of the nose or ears (bleeding inside the head), be coughed up (bleeding inside the lungs), vomited or defecated (bleeding inside the digestive tract) or urinated out (bleeding inside the urinary tract).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n78\\n\\nC.4\\n\\nFIRST AID FOR BLEEDING (IN GENERAL)\\n\\nC.4.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nA person who has an injury which is bleeding severely is in a life-threatening situation and needs immediate help. Therefore, stopping the bleeding is a core first aid activity. In addition, bleeding in the face or neck may impede the air flow to the lungs.\\n\\nThere might be an open wound that is bleeding.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe bleeding might be profuse.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be an object stuck in the wound. Even if you cannot see an object, there might be something stuck in the wound if:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured feels pain in a specific area;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person reveals a painful lump;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person feels there is something stuck in the wound;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthere is a discoloured area where the pain is.\\n\\nSuspect bleeding inside the body if the injured person:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis losing blood from body cavities (nose, ear(s), mouth, sex organs, anus);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis breathing rapidly;\\n\\n(cid:1) has a cold and clammy skin that is pale or turns blue;\\n\\n(cid:1) has a rapid heartbeat (pulse);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis behaving in an irritated or unusual way;\\n\\n(cid:1) has pain or complains about tenderness; sometimes there is also swelling in the\\n\\nabdomen or chest at the place of the suspected internal bleeding;\\n\\n(cid:1) becomes sleepy or falls unconscious.\\n\\nDo not raise an injured person’s legs if you suspect an injury to the legs or moving the legs is painful.

Make sure there is no danger to you and the person.\\n\\n2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured.\\n\\nC.4.2.2 HYGIENE\\n\\n3. Wash your hands before and after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n4. Put on gloves if available. You can also use a clean plastic bag. Try not to come in contact with the person’s blood.\\n\\nC.4.2.3\\n\\nSTOP THE BLEEDING\\n\\n5. Ask the injured to sit or lie down or put him in comfortable position.\\n\\n6. Comfort the person and explain what is happening to him. Tell the person to relax and rest. He should not try to exert.\\n\\n7. Try to stop or slow down the bleeding; press with both hands on the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n80\\n\\nAlternatively, if possible, ask the injured to press on the bleeding wound himself to stop the bleeding.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nIf you have a piece of clean (cotton) cloth, then cover the wound with it.\\n\\nIf you have no bandages, improvise with other materials.\\n\\n9. You can also wrap a bandage around the wound to slow down the bleeding, but continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops.\\n\\nMake sure the bandage is firm enough so it stops the bleeding but doesn’t cut off all the blood flow.\\n\\nIf the part of the body below the bandage changes colour or is swelling or the injured person says he is losing any feeling there, loosen the bandage a little but do not remove it. If the blood flow to a limb is stopped an injured person can lose his limb.\\n\\n10.

Even small wounds can cause tetanus and it is a very safe injection.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n86\\n\\nD.\\n\\nWOUNDS AND INJURIES\\n\\nA wound is an injury in which the skin or another surrounding surface is torn, pierced, cut or otherwise broken. Wounds can be external or internal in the body. Each type of wound carries specific risks associated with the surrounding tissue damage and infection.\\n\\nD.1\\n\\nTYPES OF WOUNDS\\n\\n(cid:1) Abrasions\\n\\nThese wounds are superficial wounds in which the top most layers of the skin are scraped off, leaving a raw, tender area. These wounds appear often when experiencing a sliding fall (e.g. of a bike). The wounds often contain embedded foreign particles which may result in infections. Abrasions do not bleed much, but are usually very painful.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIncisions\\n\\nIncised wounds are caused by sharp instruments such as a knife, razor, etc. The blood vessels show a straight cut and bleeding may be profuse. Other structures such as tendons and nerves may be damaged too.\\n\\n(cid:1) Contusions (bruises)\\n\\nContused wounds are caused by blows, by blunt instruments or by punching. The capillaries are ruptured by the punch and blood leaks into the tissues. Severe contusion might be an indication of a deeper damage, like a fracture or internal injury.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n87\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLacerations\\n\\nLacerated wounds are caused by crushing, ripping forces by machinery, or clawing of animals resulting in tears or lacerations. The edges are mostly irregular in shape. There is usually more underlying tissue damage. These wounds are often contaminated with germs; the risk of infection is high. This type of wound sometimes has less bleeding, but is usually very painful.\\n\\n(cid:1) Puncture wounds\\n\\nPuncture wounds are caused by stabs or sharp instruments like knifes, daggers or nails. These wounds typically have a smaller opening, but may reach deep into the tissue. These may not be very painful.\\n\\nA stab wound is a puncture wound by a knife or sharp blade. A gunshot wound is the wound caused by a bullet or missile driven into the body. The entry wounds of gunshot wounds are mostly small and neat. If the projectile also exits the body, the exit wound may be large and ragged.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n88\\n\\n(cid:1) Amputations\\n\\nAmputation is the removal of a limb by trauma. Re-attachment of amputated limbs, fingers or toes might be possible if the injured and the amputated part(s) arrive at the hospital as soon as possible.\\n\\nD.1.1\\n\\nCOMPLICATIONS OF WOUNDS\\n\\nWounds can cause two great dangers:\\n\\n(cid:1) Bleeding, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInfection\\n\\nD.1.1.1\\n\\nBLEEDING\\n\\nBleeding is the immediate complication of a wound and must be treated immediately.\\n\\nD.1.1.2\\n\\nINFECTION\\n\\nGerms are tiny, not visible to the human eye, organisms that can cause diseases. Germs are bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa.\\n\\nAn infection is caused by germs getting into the body through the broken skin. The germs multiply in the wound and make it ‘infected’, also called as ‘septic’. Germs may later get into the bloodstream and cause a septicaemia.\\n\\nA wound is initially not infected, even though it may be contaminated by dirt or materials that contain germs. An infection occurs after a lapse of time when the germs have time to multiply and invade the tissues. This time varies with the number of germs and their virulence and the body’s resistance to fight back. Pus formation is part of the body’s method to fight an infection.\\n\\nThe prevention of infection is very important. The first step consists of personal hygiene and the washing of your hands prior and after taking care of a person.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n89\\n\\nD.2\\n\\nSMALL CUTS AND ABRASIONS\\n\\nEven if the injured person has a small cut or abrasions, you will still need to take care of the wound to stop the bleeding and to prevent infection.\\n\\nD.2.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou might observe the following signs on a person with a cut or abrasions:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe skin or the tissue is damaged,\\n\\n(cid:1) open skin or tissue might be bleeding,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe bleeding might be minor or profuse,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe skin might be discoloured, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe casualty might feel pain.\\n\\nD.2.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nD.2.2.1\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\n1. Wash your hands before giving care. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nD.2.2.2\\n\\nSTOP THE BLEEDING AND BANDAGE THE WOUND\\n\\n2. Try to stop or slow down the bleeding: press on the wound with a clean cloth or bandage. If possible, ask the injured person to press on the cut or graze himself to stop the bleeding.\\n\\n3. Rinse out the wound with clean water. You can also use boiled and cooled water.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n90\\n\\nPour water on the wound until you cannot see any foreign material left in the wound. If necessary, wash out the wound under running water. Foreign material means dirt or anything else that comes from outside the injured person’s body.\\n\\nIn the event the wound is bleeding profusely, do not waste time cleaning it. Your priority is to stop the bleeding by applying pressure on the wound.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf you have a piece of clean (cotton) cloth, then cover the wound with it. Use adhesive strips to close a clean cut. If no strips are available, use a bandage. Bandage the dressing to the wound.\\n\\nDo not apply the bandage too firmly. If the part of the body below the bandage changes colour, is swelling or is feeling numb, loosen the bandage a little bit.\\n\\n5. Tell the injured person or the person caring for him to keep the wound dry after cleaning with water or getting wet. Every 2 or 3 days, the wound should be cleaned and the dressing changed.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf a dressing needs to be changed, do not tear the old one off as this can damage the healing wound. Instead, put enough w a t e r ( p r e f e r a b l y s a l i n e w a t e r i f a v a i l a b l e ) on the old dressing so that it comes off easily.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf the wound is infected, then always refer him to a healthcare facility for further care.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n91\\n\\nEven small wounds need attention to prevent infection. Even if the injured person has received appropriate medical care, there is a need to watch out for infection in the wound.\\n\\nThe following signs might indicate an infection:\\n\\n(cid:1) pain that is getting worse;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling, hot or red skin around the wound;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe wound shows discharge, or\\n\\n(cid:1) person having fever or feeling unwell.\\n\\nIn these cases the injured should seek further medical help.\\n\\nD.2.2.3\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nWash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n92\\n\\nD.3\\n\\nHEAD INJURIES\\n\\nThe scalp has many small blood vessels near the skin surface. Any cut can result in profuse bleeding and may make the wound appear worse than it is.\\n\\nIn case of a severe head injury, a watery fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) and blood may flow out of the nose, ear(s) or mouth.\\n\\nIn case of suspecting a severe head injury:\\n\\n1. Ask the injured not to blow his nose.\\n\\n2. Do not pack the ear or nose. You may eventually place a light dressing on the ear or nose.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf the person is breathing, put him in recovery position. Be aware of the risk of neck (spinal) injury.\\n\\n4. Urgent transport to the nearest hospital is required.\\n\\n5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nAlways urgently transport the casualty with a suspected head injury to the nearest healthcare facility,\\n\\nD.3.1\\n\\nNOSE BLEED\\n\\nThe nose contains small blood vessels that can bleed easily. A nosebleed can be the result of a blow to the nose or a trauma to the face, but can also occur spontaneously because of dryness inside the nose. Other causes include a foreign object in the nose, infection, common cold, allergies, high blood pressure, high altitude, a dry environment, alcohol abuse, disease and the use of certain medication.\\n\\nDuring a nosebleed, blood may flow from one or both nostrils. This flow may last from a few seconds to several minutes.\\n\\nIn case of a nose bleed:\\n\\n1. Ask the person to pinch his nose above the nostrils with index finger and thumb. Tell the injured person to breathe through the mouth. Ask the injured person to lean forward so that he does not swallow or breathe in blood. Swallowing blood can make the person feel sick.\\n\\n2. Pinch the nostrils for 10 to 15 minutes. If necessary, pinch the injured person’s nose yourself.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n93\\n\\nIn a few cases a nose bleed can be serious and lead to death.\\n\\nThe person should seek medical help if:\\n\\n(cid:1) blood is still coming from the nose after 20 minutes;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe nosebleed was caused by a hard punch on the nose; a fall, a road accident, etc.;\\n\\n(cid:1) blood spurts from the nose, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person turns pale, becomes sleepy or falls unconscious.\\n\\n3. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nD.3.2\\n\\nBLEEDING OF THE GUMS\\n\\nBleeding may occur immediately or after some time after a tooth extraction.\\n\\nIn case of a bleeding of the gums:\\n\\n1. The person may rinse his mouth with water or saline water.\\n\\n2. A thick cotton ball can be put in the casualty’s teeth socket and tell him to bite on the cotton ball to stop the bleeding.\\n\\n3. Refer the person to a healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n94\\n\\nD.4\\n\\nCHEST INJURIES\\n\\nInjuries to the chest are always serious. Without being visible, there might be fractures of the ribs, tear of the lung, injury to the heart and injuries to blood vessels.\\n\\nIn case of a penetrating injury a condition called ‘pneumothorax’ may occur. Air can enter between the lung membranes and exert pressure on the lung and make the lung to collapse. The pressure may build up effecting the other lung making the injured breathless.\\n\\nAir may also come out from the wound during breathing.\\n\\nIn case of a chest injury:\\n\\n1. Place him in a half-sitting position and control the bleeding by providing direct pressure to the wound. Leave the open chest wound exposed. Do not apply an occlusive dressing. Eventually put a light dressing on the wound that is not occlusive.\\n\\n2. Reassure the casualty.\\n\\n3. You may also encourage the injured to lean towards the injured side and use his hand to cover the penetration wound.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf the casualty becomes unconscious but keeps breathing, put him in the recovery position.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIf the casualty stops breathing, start CPR.\\n\\n6. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest hospital.\\n\\n7. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nAlways urgently transport the casualty with a chest injury to the nearest healthcare facility,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n95\\n\\nD.5\\n\\nABDOMINAL INJURIES\\n\\nStab wounds, gun shots or crush injuries to the abdomen cause serious and potentially life- threatening wounds.\\n\\nIn case of an abdominal injury:\\n\\n1. Control the bleeding by providing direct pressure to the wound.\\n\\n2. Put a clean cotton bandage on the wound.\\n\\n3. Adjust the position of the victim so the wound does not gap\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf the intestines come out:\\n\\nCover the intestines with a clean plastic bag or a clean pad.\\n\\nDo not touch the intestines that came out.\\n\\n5. Do not give anything to drink or eat.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf the casualty becomes unconscious but is breathing, put him in the recovery position.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf the casualty stops breathing, start CPR.\\n\\n8. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest hospital.\\n\\n9. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nAlways urgently transport the casualty with an abdominal injury to the nearest healthcare facility,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n96\\n\\nD.6\\n\\nBLEEDING FROM VARICOSE VEINS\\n\\nSwollen knobbly dilated veins, as often found in the legs, are called varices. Bleeding from varicose veins might be very profuse.\\n\\nIn case of a varicose vein bleeding:\\n\\n1. Ask the person to lie down on the floor.\\n\\n2. Raise and support the affected leg (this might help to slow down the bleeding). Apply at the same time direct pressure to the site of the bleeding.\\n\\n3. Put a bandage on the wound.\\n\\n4. Refer the person to a healthcare facility. Transport the person to the hospital if the bleeding can’t be stopped.\\n\\n5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nTransport the person to the nearest healthcare facility if the bleeding can’t be stopped.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n97\\n\\nD.7\\n\\nAMPUTATION\\n\\nRe-attachment of amputated limbs, fingers or toes might be possible if the injured and the amputated part(s) arrive at the hospital as soon as possible.\\n\\nIn case of an amputation:\\n\\n1. Control the bleeding by providing direct pressure to the wound. Put a clean cotton bandage on the wound.\\n\\n2. Place the amputated part in a clean plastic bag.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf possible, place the packed amputated part in a container of ice. Do not put ice directly on the amputated part – the amputated part should always be packed in a clean plastic bag.\\n\\nDo not put liquids or antiseptic products on the amputated part.\\n\\n4. Mark the package clearly with the casualty’s name and the time the amputation occurred.\\n\\n5. Arrange urgent transport of the casualty and the amputated part to the nearest hospital.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n98\\n\\n6. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nAlways urgently transport the casualty suffering an amputation injury to the nearest healthcare facility, If the amputated part has been recovered, do not forget to send it together with the casualty.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n99\\n\\nD.8\\n\\nCRUSH INJURIES\\n\\nTraffic accidents, building site accidents, explosions and natural disasters (e.g. landslides, earthquakes) are the most common causes of crush injuries. Crush injuries may include fractures, bleedings and swelling.\\n\\nIn case of a crush injury:\\n\\n1. Try to keep the head of the victim as low as possible.\\n\\n2. Monitor the respiration and consciousness of the victim.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf the victim stops breathing, start CPR.\\n\\n4. Arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\n5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nAlways urgently transport a casualty suffering (potential) crush injuries to the nearest healthcare facility,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n100\\n\\nD.9\\n\\nSHOCK\\n\\nThis life-threatening condition occurs when the circulatory system fails and as a result vital organs such as the heart and the brain are deprived of oxygen. It requires emergency treatment to prevent permanent organ damage and death.\\n\\nShock can be made worse by fear and pain. Whenever there is a risk of shock developing, reassuring the casualty, making him comfortable and keeping him warm may be sufficient to prevent him from deteriorating.\\n\\nD.9.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF SHOCK\\n\\n(cid:1) Hypovolemic shock\\n\\nThe most common cause of shock is severe blood loss. If the blood loss exceeds 1.2 litres (this is about one-fifth of the normal blood volume of an adult), shock may occur. The blood loss may occur due to external and/or internal bleedings.\\n\\nLoss of other body fluids can also result in shock. Conditions that cause heavy fluid losses include diarrhoea, severe burns, etc.\\n\\n(cid:1) Cardiogenic shock\\n\\nIn addition, shock may occur when an adequate volume of blood is available, but the heart is unable to pump the blood around. This problem can be due to severe heart diseases, heart attack or acute heart failure.\\n\\n(cid:1) Other types of shock\\n\\nOther causes of shock include overwhelming infections (septic shock), lack of certain hormones, low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) (metabolic shock), under-cooling (hypothermia), injuries to the respiratory track or lungs (respiratory shock) and severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock), drug overdose or spinal cord injuries (neurogenic shock).\\n\\nD.9.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou might observe following symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInitially:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrapid pulse;\\n\\n(cid:1) pale looks;\\n\\n(cid:1) cold clammy, sweaty skin.\\n\\n(cid:1) As shock develops:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrapid, shallow breathing;\\n\\n(cid:1) cold, clammy skin;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrapid, weak pulse;\\n\\n(cid:1) dizziness or fainting;\\n\\n(cid:1) weakness;\\n\\n(cid:1) eyes appear to stare;\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n101\\n\\n(cid:1) anxiety or agitation;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nseizures;\\n\\n(cid:1) confusion or unresponsiveness;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlow or no urine output;\\n\\n(cid:1) bluish lips and fingernails;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsweating;\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea and vomiting might occur.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty might feel thirsty.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty might become restlessness and aggressive.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty might complain of chest pain.\\n\\nD.9.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n1. Reassure the casualty (when conscious)\\n\\n2. Treat the possible cause of shock that you can detect, such as a severe bleeding.\\n\\n3. Lay the casualty comfortably on his back on a blanket.\\n\\nHowever, in cases of injury of the head, chest or of the abdomen, lower the head slightly and turn it to a side.\\n\\nIn cases of vomiting put the casualty in the recovery position.\\n\\n4. You may raise and support the legs. However, do not do this when you suspect a fracture or spinal injuries.\\n\\n5. Loosen the tight clothing.\\n\\n6. Keep the injured person warm by taking off wet clothing, covering him with a blanket or other covering, taking care not to overheat him.\\n\\nNever use hot water bottles or very warm rugs.\\n\\nDo not rub any part of the body to get him warm.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIn case of major injuries nothing should be given by mouth as he may later need an operation or blood transfusion.\\n\\nThe general principle is never to give food or drink to a casualty. Important exceptions include hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycaemic shock (low blood sugar in a diabetes patient), diarrhoea and fever leading to dehydration and in case of heat exhaustion or heatstroke when the person remains conscious.\\n\\n8.

The bones also provide attachment for muscles that move the head and control facial expressions and chewing.\\n\\nE.1.2\\n\\nTHE BACKBONE OR SPINE (VERTEBRAL COLUMN)\\n\\nThe vertebral column consists of 33 small pieces of bones, each called a vertebra (plural: vertebrae), placed one above the other starting from skull to the tail bone below.\\n\\nThe vertebral column can be divided in different regions:\\n\\n(cid:1) 7 cervical vertebrae in the neck referred to as C1-C7;\\n\\n(cid:1) 12 thoracic or dorsal vertebrae from the back referred to as T1-T12;\\n\\n(cid:1) 5 lumbar vertebrae at the waist region form the lower back referred to as L1-L5;\\n\\n(cid:1) 5 sacral vertebrae at the hip region, fused together, form the sacrum; and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe remaining four form the tail bones.\\n\\nBetween each pair of vertebrae is a disk of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber and allows movement. Muscles and ligaments attached to the vertebrae stabilize the spine and control the movement of the back. Inside the central canal the spinal cord passes which carries impulses from and to the brain.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n106\\n\\nE.1.3\\n\\nTHE RIBS AND BREAST BONE (STERNUM)\\n\\nThe lungs and heart are protected by the thoracic cage. It consists of twelve pairs of ribs, attached to the corresponding vertebrae at the back. The first seven pairs of the ribs are attached to the breastbone (also called sternum) in the front. The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs of ribs are each attached to the rib above. The eleventh and twelfth pair of ribs have no frontal attachment and are called floating ribs.\\n\\nE.1.4\\n\\nTHE SHOULDERS AND UPPER LIMBS (ARM, ELBOW, WRIST AND HAND)\\n\\nE.1.4.1\\n\\nTHE SHOULDER\\n\\nEach shoulder consists of following bones:\\n\\n(cid:1) a collar bone (Clavicle) in the front on each side of the upper part of the breast\\n\\nbone, and\\n\\n(cid:1) a shoulder blade (Scapula) on each side at the upper outer back.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n107\\n\\nE.1.4.2\\n\\nTHE UPPER LIMB: ARM, ELBOW, WRIST AND HAND\\n\\nThe bones of the upper limbs (arms) are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe upper arm, called humerus;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe forearm bones:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe outer side forearm bone or radius,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe inner side forearm bone or ulna.\\n\\nThe joint between the upper arm and forearm is called the elbow.\\n\\nThere are eight carpal bones in each wrist, five metacarpal bones in each palm and three small bones called phalanges in each finger (only two in each thumb).\\n\\nE.1.5\\n\\nTHE PELVIS AND LOWER LIMBS (LEG, KNEE, ANKLE AND FOOT)\\n\\nE.1.5.1\\n\\nTHE PELVIS\\n\\nTwo hip bones, one on either side, join together to form the pelvis. The hip bones are attached at the back with the lower part of the vertebral column. At the front, it is attached together with ligament called symphysis pubis.\\n\\nThe pelvis forms a basin shaped cavity which contains intestines, urinary bladder and reproductive organs. There are two sockets one on either side of the pelvis, where the thigh bones join forming the hip joint.\\n\\nE.1.5.2\\n\\nTHE LOWER LIMB: LEG, KNEE, ANKLE AND FOOT\\n\\nThe thigh bone, called femur, is the longest and strongest bone in the body. Its upper end forms a part of the hip joint while its lower end forms a part of the knee joint.\\n\\nThe knee joint in the front is covered with a small bone called the knee cap or patella, which can easily be felt under the skin.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n108\\n\\nThe two bones of the lower part of the leg are the shin bone, called tibia, and the outer bone, called fibula. The tibia extends from the knee joint to the ankle joint. Its sharp edge can be felt immediately beneath the skin of the front of the leg. The fibula lies on the outer side of the tibia. It does not enter in to the formation of the knee-joint; its lower end forms the outer part of the ankle-joint.\\n\\nThere are seven tarsal bones and five metatarsal bones in each foot, and three small bones called phalanges in each finger (two in each big toe).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n109\\n\\nE.2\\n\\nJOINTS\\n\\nJoints are the places at the junction of two or more bones.\\n\\nThere may be no movement (immovable joints) as in skull or there may be free movements (movable joints) as in knee, elbow, shoulder and hip joints.\\n\\nIn movable joints, the ends of the bones are covered by cartilage, the joint is encased in a capsule containing a lubricant material.\\n\\nThere are three types of movable joints:\\n\\n(cid:1) Ball and socket joints as found in the shoulder and hip. The round head of the bone enters the socket of the other bone, allowing movement in several directions and planes.\\n\\n(cid:1) Hinge joints as the ankle, elbow or the knee. These joints allow only movement in\\n\\none plane only as with the hinge of a door.\\n\\n(cid:1) Gliding joints as in the wrist, feet, between the ribs and the vertebras of the spinal\\n\\ncolumn. These joints allow only limited movements.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n110\\n\\nE.3\\n\\nMUSCLES\\n\\nMuscles to the layman mean “flesh” and produce movement of the limbs and organs.\\n\\nAn individual muscle consists of bundles of long muscle fibres. The whole muscle is covered with a strong connective tissue sheath and attached to a bone by inextensible tendons.\\n\\nThere are two types of muscles:\\n\\n(cid:1) Voluntary muscles, which are under the control of the will and are generally\\n\\nattached to the skeleton.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInvoluntary muscles, like those found in the heart and digestive system, work without the control of the will, but are under the influence of the autonomous nervous system.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n111\\n\\nE.4\\n\\nFRACTURES (INJURIES TO BONES)\\n\\nA fracture is a break/bend or crack in a bone. Generally, a considerable force is needed to break a bone, unless it is diseased or old. The bones that are still growing are supple and may split, bend, or crack.\\n\\nE.4.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF FRACTURES\\n\\nFractures may happen when direct (a blow) or indirect force (a twist, a wrench) is inflicted on a bone.\\n\\nE.4.1.1\\n\\nDIRECT FORCE\\n\\nThe bone breaks at the spot of application of the force e.g. a severe fall on a projecting stone, a bullet passing into bones, or a wheel passing over the body, etc.\\n\\nE.4.1.2\\n\\nINDIRECT FORCE\\n\\nThe bone breaks at the spot away from the spot of application of force e.g. collar-bone- fracture when the fall is on outstretched hands, etc.\\n\\nE.4.1.3\\n\\nMUSCULAR FORCE\\n\\nThe fracture occurs due to a violent contraction of a group of muscles (e.g. fracture of ribs on violent cough). This type of fracture happens very rarely and is mostly related to other underlying diseases (e.g. weakened bone structure).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n112\\n\\nE.4.2\\n\\nTYPES OF FRACTURES\\n\\nE.4.2.1\\n\\nOPEN AND CLOSED FRACTURES\\n\\nE.4.2.1.1 CLOSED FRACTURES\\n\\nThe skin above the fracture is intact, although the bone ends may have damaged nearby tissues and blood vessels.\\n\\nE.4.2.1.2 OPEN FRACTURES (COMPOUND FRACTURES)\\n\\nThe skin above the fracture is not intact. There is bleeding. The bone is exposed to the outside air at the surface; dirt, dust and germs can enter the wound. There is a high risk of infection.\\n\\nE.4.2.2\\n\\nSIMPLE AND COMPLEX FRACTURES\\n\\nThe term “complex fracture” describes a broken bone that is more severe than what is more common. Fractures are considered to be complex when:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe bones are broken into many pieces.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe soft tissues and vital organs are severely damaged.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere are multiple fractures at several levels in a single bone.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere is an associated joint dislocation or joint injury.\\n\\nOtherwise, the fracture can be classified as a ‘simple fracture’.\\n\\nE.4.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffered a fracture:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe injured complains of pain at the spot of fracture or around it.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe injured complains of tenderness i.e. pain on touching over the injured spot.\\n\\nNever press hard on a suspected fracture spot!\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be swelling of the area of the fracture.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be a bleeding at the location of the fracture.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe bone might be sticking out.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be a discoloration in the area of the fracture.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe injured may have lost the capability of normal movements of the affected part.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n113\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be a deformity of the affected limb. The limb may have lost its normal shape. Sometimes the muscles may pull up the lower free end, causing an apparent shortening of the limb.\\n\\n(cid:1) An irregular outline of the bone can be felt (e.g. on lower limb fractures).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe injured may feel an unnatural movement at the spot of fracture.\\n\\nThe response of an injured person to a dislocated limb or a broken bone can be very different. Some people might even be able to walk with a broken leg with some pain, whilst others might not be able to move at all.\\n\\nIf you are not sure whether a bone is broken, it is safer to assume that it has broken.\\n\\nIf the broken leg looks deformed or dislocated, do not try to reset it. This might make the injury worse and will cause pain.\\n\\nE.4.4\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nE.4.4.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1. Make sure there is no danger to you and the person.\\n\\n2. The person needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. HYGIENE\\n\\n2. The person needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. HYGIENE\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf possible, wash your hands before taking care of the injured. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n4. Use gloves to protect yourself. If gloves are not available, you can use a clean plastic bag. Try not to come in contact with the person’s blood.\\n\\nE.4.4.3\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n5. Fractures often occur in major accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to treat other potential injuries also. The first aider must decide which injury is more urgent.\\n\\nProviding CPR when the victim does not breathe, or treating a severe bleeding is more urgent and should be handled on priority.\\n\\n6. There may be more than one fracture in the same patient or even in the same limb.\\n\\n7. Try not to move the broken or dislocated limb unnecessarily.\\n\\nTry not to move the casualty until the injured part has been secured.\\n\\nIf you need to move the victim, be careful when moving or turning him. It is better to ask assistance by bystanders.\\n\\n8. Reassure the casualty.\\n\\n9. Advice the person to keep calm.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n114\\n\\n10. If the casualty is able to support the injured part, ask him to do so; else, support the injured part with your hands or ask a bystander to do so.\\n\\nYou can immobilize the injured part with a bandage or a splint (if the first aider is experienced in these techniques). If you applied a splint or bandage, check the circulation below the bandage or splinting (e.g. at finger or toe level).\\n\\n11. Arrange appropriate transport to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\n12. Continuously observe the casualty.\\n\\n13. Do not give the casualty anything to eat or drink.\\n\\nE.4.4.3.1 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE IS ALSO A SEVERE BLEEDING?\\n\\nPress on the bleeding to stop it and put a pressure bandage on the wound.\\n\\nE.4.4.3.2 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON BECOMES UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING?\\n\\n1. Put the person in the recovery position.\\n\\n2. Continue to observe the victim and check his breathing.\\n\\nE.4.4.3.3 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING?\\n\\nPerform CPR.\\n\\nDo not interrupt the resuscitation until:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe victim starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally;\\n\\n(cid:1) help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over;\\n\\n(cid:1) you become too exhausted to continue; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nE.4.4.4\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nAlways wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nE.4.5\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways transport or refer a person suffering a (potential) fracture to a nearby healthcare facility.\\n\\nA treatment by bonesetters is not recommended.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n115\\n\\nE.5\\n\\nINJURIES AND FRACTURES TO THE HEAD, NECK AND SPINE\\n\\nHead, neck and spinal injuries can be very serious and should always be managed with caution!\\n\\nUnblocking the breathing passage takes priority over concerns about a potential spinal injury. When a person needs to be put in the recovery position to keep the airways open, this takes priority over potential spinal injury. If possible, support the person’s neck while turning him into the recovery position.\\n\\nE.5.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF HEAD, NECK AND SPINAL INJURIES AND FRACTURES.\\n\\nFractures of the skull can be caused by a direct blow or a fall on the head.\\n\\nFractures of the base of the skull can be caused by an indirect injury, e.g. a fall on the feet, a fall on the lower part of the spine (buttock) or a severe blow to the side of the head.\\n\\nFractures of the lower jaw are mostly the result of a direct force. Usually one side of the jaw is affected; however, both sides might be fractured. In most cases, the fracture is an open (compound) fracture as there is usually a wound inside the mouth also.\\n\\nSpinal fractures can happen indirectly when landing on the feet or buttocks in a heavy fall, when being thrown forward suddenly (like in a car accident during a collision) or when lifting a very heavy weight. A whiplash injury is a specific neck injury caused by a fast movement of the head forward and backwards (e.g. during a car collision).\\n\\nDirect spinal fractures can be caused by falling from a height on the back across a bar or a fall of a heavy weight on the back (e.g. during an earthquake or landslide)\\n\\nE.5.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou should suspect a potential serious injury if the person:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfell from a height greater than his own standing height;\\n\\n(cid:1) was involved in a road accident and suffered a hard blow;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis feeling nausea or is vomiting (throwing-up);\\n\\n(cid:1) does not remember exactly what has happened;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis behaving in an irritated or unusual way after the accident;\\n\\n(cid:1) complains of blurring vision;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeels pain or tenderness in the head, neck or back;\\n\\n(cid:1) has serious wounds or injuries to the head;\\n\\n(cid:1) has serious injuries on the legs and does not complain about pain;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeels like he has been cut in half;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nis sleepy, drowsy or loses (has lost) consciousness;\\n\\n(cid:1) has a fit; or\\n\\n(cid:1) has an unequal pupil size.\\n\\nBlood and brain fluid (CSF) may flow from the ear and/or nose in case of fracture of base of skull.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n116\\n\\nE.5.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nE.5.3.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

Tap him on the shoulders and ask if he is okay. Do not shake the person too roughly.\\n\\n4. Check if the injured is conscious or unconscious and act accordingly.\\n\\nTo do so:\\n\\nCheck if the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘What is your name?’\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘Where do you live?’\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘How old are you?’\\n\\nCheck if the injured person responds to simple commands:\\n\\n(cid:1) “Squeeze my hand?”\\n\\n(cid:1) “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand”\\n\\nIf there is no response, pinch the person and check if he opens his eyes or moves.\\n\\nIf the injured person responds, do not try to change the position of the person when there is a head, neck, back and leg or arm injury.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n117\\n\\n5. Tell the person to stay calm and not to move.\\n\\n6. Assure the person that you will stay with him and help is being arranged.\\n\\n7. To keep the head still, place your hands or tightly folded clothing on each side of the injured person’s head. Keep the head and neck of the person still only if the person allows you to do so. If the injured does not allow you to hold his head, do not enforce.\\n\\n7. To keep the head still, place your hands or tightly folded clothing on each side of the injured person’s head.

The supporting tendons at the joint (the ligaments) might be damaged.\\n\\nThe response of an injured person to a dislocated limb can be very different.\\n\\nIf you are not sure whether a bone is dislocated, always seek medical help.\\n\\nE.10.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF DISLOCATIONS\\n\\nDislocations are mostly the result of an external force that impacts the body.\\n\\nFor example: a dislocation of a shoulder can happen by a heavy fall on the hand. A dislocation of the jaw can happen due to wide/violent yawning or blows on the chin.\\n\\nE.10.2 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nIf a person has dislocated bone, you might observe the following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe lower jaw may limp downwards when dislocated.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe joint looks deformed.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person has pain.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty cannot move the joint.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be swelling and bruising in the area of the injury in due course of time.\\n\\nE.10.3 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not try to reset the dislocated bone back into in place.\\n\\n(cid:1) Verify the colour of the nails of the hand of a dislocated elbow as the dislocation\\n\\nmight traumatize an artery.\\n\\n(cid:1) Provide first aid as follows:\\n\\nDislocation of:\\n\\nTreat the same as:\\n\\nJaw\\n\\nFracture of jaw\\n\\nShoulder\\n\\nFracture of shoulder\\n\\nElbow\\n\\nFracture of elbow\\n\\nFingers\\n\\nFracture of fingers\\n\\nE.10.4 WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nA casualty with a suspected dislocation should be transported or referred to a nearby healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n141\\n\\nE.11\\n\\nSTRAINS AND SPRAINS (INJURIES TO LIGAMENTS, MUSCLES AND TENDONS)\\n\\nA muscle can be strained by overstretching it. Muscles can also be ruptured (a tear): the muscle itself or the tendon is then torn. A sprain is when the ligaments of a joint or the tissues surrounding the joint are torn.\\n\\nE.11.1 CAUSES OF STRAINS AND SPRAINS\\n\\nStrains might happen as the result of a twist or sudden effort, like lifting a heavy object.\\n\\nSprains might be caused by a sudden wrenching or twisting of the joint. Ankle sprains are quite a common example of this.\\n\\nE.11.2 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nIn case of a strain you might observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1) pain in the affected muscle,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling,\\n\\n(cid:1) bruising, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nloss of movement.\\n\\nIn case of a sprain you might observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty complains of pain around the affected joint.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty reports having felt a sudden sharp pain in the muscle.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty is unable to use or put weight on the joint.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling,\\n\\n(cid:1) bruising, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntenderness.\\n\\nE.11.3 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nE.11.3.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST\\n\\n1.

(cid:1) Unconsciousness. (cid:1) Head injuries. (cid:1) Stroke. (cid:1) Fits – convulsions – seizures. (cid:1) Epilepsy.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n144\\n\\nF.1\\n\\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nThe nervous system consists of:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe brain,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe spinal cord, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe nerves.\\n\\nAnatomically the nervous system is divided in a central and a peripheral nervous system.\\n\\nF.1.1\\n\\nTHE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nThe central nervous system (CNS) comprises of the brain and the spinal cord.\\n\\nF.1.1.1\\n\\nTHE BRAIN\\n\\nThe brain is an extremely delicate structure made up of a mass of nerve cells. It is here that sensations are analysed and orders are given to the muscles.\\n\\nThe brain is encased in the skull and suspended in a clear fluid, called the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which acts as a partial shock absorber. Nonetheless, since the brain is free to move within the skull the brain is sensitive to violent movements or pressure.\\n\\nThe brain has three main structures:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe cerebrum, which is concerned with thought, sensation, and conscious movement;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe cerebellum, which coordinates movement, balance, and posture; and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe brain stem, which controls basic functions such as breathing.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n145\\n\\nF.1.1.2\\n\\nTHE SPINAL CORD\\n\\nThe spinal cord is a mass of nerve fibres extending from the brain through an opening in the base of the skull. The cord runs through the spinal column.\\n\\nThe main function of the spinal cord is to convey signals between the brain and the peripheral nervous system.\\n\\nF.1.2\\n\\nTHE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PNS)\\n\\nThe peripheral nerves emerge in pairs, each containing motor and sensory nerves, from the brain and spinal cord. Sensory nerves transmit impressions received by the senses (sight, hearing, touch etc.) to the brain and motor nerves then transmit the ‘orders’ given by the brain to the voluntary muscles. When a nerve is cut there is a loss of feeling, power and movement in that part of the body which is controlled by that nerve.\\n\\nThe peripheral nervous system can be divided in voluntary or somatic nervous system and an autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nF.1.2.1\\n\\nTHE SOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nThe somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that is responsible for carrying motor and sensory information both to and from the central nervous system. This system is made up of nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs and all skeletal muscles. The system is responsible for nearly all voluntary muscle movements as well as for processing sensory information that arrives via external stimuli including hearing, touch and sight.\\n\\nF.1.2.2\\n\\nTHE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nThe autonomic nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates key involuntary functions of the body. This system is not controlled by the will and acts continuously whether a person is awake or asleep. It controls different body functions including the activity of the heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the glands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system, which accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n146\\n\\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n147\\n\\nF.2\\n\\nUNCONSCIOUSNESS\\n\\nUnconsciousness is a state in which the casualty becomes insensible to commands because of an interruption to the normal functioning of the brain. A person has perhaps lost consciousness if he does not react to your action by opening his eyes or answering your questions.\\n\\nThere is no absolute dividing line between consciousness and un- consciousness. People can be fully conscious (aware and awake) or fully unconscious (no reaction to any stimulus) or at any level between these two extremes.\\n\\nLoss of consciousness causes the muscles to relax. During the period of unconsciousness the tongue might fall backwards and block the breathing passage.\\n\\nIn fainting, the unconscious state is usually brief as in vasovagal syncope. Fainting can occur due to various reasons such as emotional distress, tiredness, hunger, standing up for long period, a sudden change in body position, being a long time in a hot environment, or specific medical conditions. Pregnant women, children and the elderly can be more vulnerable to these causes.\\n\\nLonger periods of unconsciousness are more serious. Causes include head injuries, cardiac arrest, stroke or poisoning.\\n\\nIn an unconscious state, the person will be unresponsive to your activities (touching, sounds or other stimulation).\\n\\nCheck the following:\\n\\n(cid:1) Whether the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions:\\n\\n(cid:1) “What is your name?”\\n\\n(cid:1) “Where do you live?”\\n\\n(cid:1) “How old are you?”\\n\\n(cid:1) Whether the person responds to simple commands:\\n\\n(cid:1) “Squeeze my hand.”\\n\\n(cid:1) “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand.”\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf there is no response, pinch the person and see if he opens his eyes or moves.\\n\\nIf the person does not react to any of these stimuli, he is in an unconscious state.\\n\\nNote that a person might only partially respond to the stimuli you provide (sound, touch, pain); he might be in an in-between state.\\n\\nWhen the person becomes conscious again after a period of unconsciousness, he might suffer from:\\n\\n(cid:1) confusion,\\n\\n(cid:1) drowsiness,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlight-headedness,\\n\\n(cid:1) headache,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nloss of bowel and bladder control (incontinence),\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n148\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfits, and\\n\\n(cid:1) difficulty speaking.\\n\\nThe first aider can measure and record a patient\\'s responsiveness and level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (see chapter on basic first aid techniques).\\n\\nF.2.1\\n\\nCAUSES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS\\n\\nThere are many causes of unconsciousness and it can occur as a result of a:\\n\\n(cid:1) head injury resulting in a concussion of the brain or a compression of the brain due\\n\\nto swelling or bleeding;\\n\\n(cid:1) disturbance of the blood supply to the brain, as in fainting, shock or stroke;\\n\\n(cid:1) disturbance in the chemical composition of the blood, e.g. lack of oxygen as in asphyxia, abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetes or presence of poisonous substances in the blood; or\\n\\n(cid:1) disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain, e.g. as in epilepsy.\\n\\nF.2.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nF.2.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders.\\n\\nF.2.2.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n2. Talk loudly to the casualty. Tap him on the shoulders and ask if he is ok. Do not shake the person too roughly.\\n\\n3. Check if the casualty is conscious or unconscious and act accordingly.\\n\\nTo do so:\\n\\na. Talk loudly to person, shake him gently\\n\\nb. Check if the person opens his eyes and responds to simple questions:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘What is your name?’\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘Where do you live?’\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n‘How old are you?’\\n\\nc. Check if the injured person responds to simple commands:\\n\\n(cid:1) “Squeeze my hand?”\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n149\\n\\n(cid:1) “Move your arm/leg/foot/hand”\\n\\nd. If there is no response, pinch the person and check if he opens his eyes or\\n\\nmoves.\\n\\nThe first aider can measure and record a patient\\'s responsiveness and level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (see chapter on basic first aid techniques).\\n\\nF.2.2.2.1 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE CASUALTY RESPONDS?\\n\\n1. Try not to change the position of the person if there has been a head, neck, back, leg or arm injury.\\n\\n2. Try to find out what happened to the person.\\n\\n3. Tell the person to stay calm and not to move (if at all possible).\\n\\n4. Look and feel for breathing\\n\\n5. Keep checking the casualty to make sure he is not getting worse.\\n\\n6. Verify regularly the level of consciousness and breathing.\\n\\n7. Find medical help for the person if needed.\\n\\nF.2.2.2.2 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE CASUALTY DOES NOT RESPOND?\\n\\n1. Try not to change the position of the person if there has been a head, neck, back, leg or arm injury.\\n\\n2. The injured person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured. If you have gloves, put them on. Do not search for gloves if not available and continue with the next step.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n150\\n\\n4. You must unblock the breathing passage:\\n\\na. Gently roll the person over on to his back.\\n\\nb . Carefully tilt his head back and lift the chin up with your hand on the bony part of the chin. This simple action lifts the tongue from the back of the throat.\\n\\nc . Do not put your hand on the soft part under the chin to do this!\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIf the person is breathing, put him in the recovery position.\\n\\na. Be careful when moving and turning the victim. It is better to ask assistance\\n\\nby bystanders.\\n\\nb. Do not leave the person alone and keep checking his breathing.\\n\\nc. Keep the injured person warm by taking off wet clothing, covering him with\\n\\na blanket or other covering, taking care not to overheat him.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf not done yet, arrange transport to a healthcare facility.\\n\\nF.2.2.2.3 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING?\\n\\nPerform CPR.\\n\\nDo not interrupt the resuscitation until:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe victim starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally\\n\\n(cid:1) help (trained in CPR) arrives and takes over;\\n\\n(cid:1) you become too exhausted to continue; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe scene becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n151\\n\\nF.2.2.2.4\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nAlways wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nF.2.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways urgently transport an unconscious person to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nAnyone who has become unconscious or who is feeling sick, has pain after fainting (e.g. in the head or heart region, or from trauma resulting from the fall), is on medication or is being treated for a medical condition, should always seek medical help.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n152\\n\\nF.3\\n\\nHEAD INJURIES\\n\\nHead injuries can be a concussion, a cerebral compression, or fracture of the skull. All head injuries are potentially serious and require a proper assessment because they can impair consciousness.\\n\\nHead injuries can be associated with damage to the brain tissue itself, damage to blood vessels inside the skull, skull fractures, brain concussions, and compression of brain tissue because of built up pressure due to swelling or bleeding.\\n\\nAssume always that casualty suffering from head injury might also be having a neck or spinal injury.\\n\\nF.3.1\\n\\nCONCUSSION\\n\\nA concussion is a ‘shake-up’ of the brain inside the skull. It can be caused by a blow on the head or a fall. There is a brief period of impaired consciousness following the blow to the head. The casualty might complain of dizziness, headache, blurred vision or nausea. Typically there is a brief loss of memory of any events that occurred at the time of, or immediately preceding, the injury.\\n\\nF.3.2\\n\\nCEREBRAL COMPRESSION\\n\\nSome head injuries may produce a compression of brain tissue. The pressure inside the skull builds up by swelling or bleeding inside the skull. This condition is life threatening.\\n\\nCasualties show a deteriorating level of consciousness that may progress to unconsciousness. Therefore, it is important to observe continuously the conscious level of a casualty that experienced a head trauma.\\n\\nOther signs and symptoms you may observe are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of an intense headache.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of dizziness.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of drowsiness.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of blurred or double vision\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe breathing gets noisy and becomes slow.\\n\\n(cid:1) A slow but strong pulse (can be felt if the first aider is experienced in the technique\\n\\nof taking the pulse).\\n\\n(cid:1) Unequal pupil size.\\n\\n(cid:1) Weakness and/or paralysis on one side of the face and/or body.\\n\\n(cid:1) A change in the behaviour or the personality of the casualty.\\n\\nF.3.3\\n\\nSKULL FRACTURES\\n\\nIf the casualty has a head wound or bruise, be alert for a possible skull fracture also. A skull fracture is a serious condition because of the underlying risk of brain damage and bleeding.\\n\\nYou might observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere is a soft area or a depression on the scalp.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n153\\n\\n(cid:1) Asymmetry of the head or skull.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere is bruising or swelling behind the ear(s).\\n\\n(cid:1) Clear watery fluid (CSF) or blood is leaking from the casualty’s ear or nose.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty has a deteriorating level of response which may progress to unconsciousness.\\n\\nF.3.4\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n1. Approach a casualty who experienced a period of impaired consciousness as described in the chapter on unconsciousness.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf there is a risk of fractures of the skull, neck or spine: treat the casualty accordingly as described in the chapter on injuries and fractures to the head, neck and spine.\\n\\nIf there is a risk of fractures of the skull, neck or spine, treat the casualty accordingly (see chapter on Injuries and fractures to the head, neck and spine).\\n\\nF.3.5\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways urgently transport an unconscious casualty to the nearest healthcare facility. Injured people suspected of having head, neck or spinal injuries should always be examined urgently in the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nAnyone who has become unconscious or who is feeling sick, has pain after fainting (e.g. in the head or heart region, or from trauma resulting from the fall), is on medication or is being treated for a medical condition, should always visit the healthcare facility for medical check.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n154\\n\\nF.4\\n\\nSTROKE\\n\\n‘Stroke’ is a rapid loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. It can be the result of bleeding or when a blood clot leads to a blockage in a blood vessel to the brain, blocking the blood flow. As a result the affected brain part can’t function normally and this might result in difficulty in moving, speaking, understanding, etc. Symptoms occur suddenly and depend on the area of the brain affected.\\n\\nStrokes occur commonly in later life and in patients that suffer high blood pressure or other circulatory disorder\\n\\nF.4.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou might observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of numbness;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of blurred vision;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person talks with a slurred speech;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of severe headache;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person seems confused;\\n\\n(cid:1) You may observe:\\n\\n(cid:1) weakness or paralysis of the limbs,\\n\\n(cid:1) weakness or paralysis in the face.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSometimes the person might even have loss of consciousness.\\n\\nThe possibility of stroke should always be considered when there is:\\n\\n(cid:1) a sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of\\n\\nthe body; and/or\\n\\n(cid:1) a sudden trouble in speaking, seeing or understanding.\\n\\nF.4.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIf you think someone is suffering from a stroke, you can ask the person to perform three simple actions to check.\\n\\nYou can easily remember this via the mnemonic ‘FAST’: Face – Arm – Speech and Transport.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n155\\n\\nF\\n\\n2. Ask the person to smile or to show his teeth.\\n\\nCheck whether the mouth is crooked or drooping at one corner.\\n\\nThere might be saliva dribbling out of the mouth.\\n\\nA\\n\\n3. Ask the person to lift both arms.\\n\\nCheck whether he can do this without one arm dropping or drifting. Can he do this? Is one arm lower than the other?\\n\\nA stroke often causes one side of the body to become weak or even paralyzed.\\n\\nThe person might also have lost his balance.\\n\\nS\\n\\n4. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence after you. Check whether he can speak clearly or if he has problems in saying the words.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n156\\n\\nA stroke is very likely if the person has difficulties with any of the above actions.\\n\\nT\\n\\n5. Arrange transport quickly. The earlier the person is treated, the better i s the outcome. Try to find out when the problem started, note it down and report it.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf you think the person suffers from a stroke, the person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf the person can sit up, make him to sit upright. This helps the person to breathe.\\n\\nIf the person cannot sit up, place him in the recovery position.\\n\\n8. Comfort the person and explain what is happening. Tell the person to relax and rest.\\n\\n9. He should not try to do anything.\\n\\n10. Do not give food or drink to the person having a stroke. There is an increased risk of choking or vomiting.\\n\\n11. Keep checking that the person is awake and breathing properly.\\n\\n12. Arrange urgent transport to a healthcare facility.\\n\\n13. Always wash your hands after taking care of a person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol- based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nF.4.2.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO IF THE PERSON IS UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING?\\n\\na. Put the person in the recovery position.\\n\\nb. Continue to observe the victim and check his breathing\\n\\nF.4.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON STOPS BREATHING?\\n\\nStart CPR.\\n\\nDo not interrupt the resuscitation until:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe person starts to wake up, moves, opens his eyes and breathes normally;\\n\\n(cid:1) help (trained on CPR) arrives and takes over;\\n\\n(cid:1) you become too exhausted to continue; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe area becomes unsafe for you to continue.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n157\\n\\nF.4.4\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility. This should be done even if the symptoms improve.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n158\\n\\nF.5\\n\\nFITS – CONVULSIONS - SEIZURES\\n\\nA person has a fit (a seizure or convulsions) if he suddenly shakes uncontrollably. It is different from normal shivering and trembling. It may manifest in all limbs or just be limited to a single limb.\\n\\nThe person having the fit may urinate and defecate without control. A fit can be caused by high fever, diseases (e.g. malaria, epilepsy…), poisoning (e.g. alcohol, drugs…) or a trauma (e.g. brain injury).\\n\\nEpilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder) in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour, sensations and sometimes loss of consciousness. Epilepsy is usually a disease of the young. In the beginning the frequency of convulsions is usually less, but they become more and more frequent later. Epilepsy seizures may be of a ‘minor’ or ‘major’ kind. In minor epilepsy seizures, the casualty becomes pale, his eyes become fixed and staring and he becomes unconscious for a few seconds. He resumes his work soon as though nothing had happened. A major epilepsy seizure (also known as ‘grand mal seizures’) is serious. The attack follows a headache, restlessness or a feeling of dullness. The casualty is usually aware that he is going to get an attack of an epileptic fit.\\n\\nChildren under the age of four often develop fits as a result of high temperature (fever) caused by infectious diseases. A child having a fit should be brought to a nearby healthcare facility for urgent examination by a doctor.\\n\\nF.5.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou may observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsudden uncontrollable shaking;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfalling down on the floor;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nloss of consciousness;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfoaming at the mouth; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe person might have earlier mentioned that he smelled, felt, tasted, heard or saw things differently.\\n\\nIf the fit is due to high temperature (fever):\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe skin might then feel hot and look reddish.\\n\\nF.5.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nF.5.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST\\n\\n1.

The unique structure of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) allows it to perform its specialized functions to turn food into the energy for survival and packaging the residue for waste disposal.\\n\\n(cid:1) Mouth\\n\\nThe mouth or oral cavity is the beginning of the digestive tract. In fact, digestion starts here when taking the first bite of food. Chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested, while saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breaking it down into a form the body can absorb and use.\\n\\n(cid:1) Oesophagus\\n\\nLocated in throat cavity near your trachea (windpipe), the gullet, also called oesophagus, receives food from the mouth when swallowing. By means of a series of muscular contractions, the oesophagus delivers food to the stomach.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nStomach\\n\\nThe stomach is a hollow organ that holds food while it is being mixed with enzymes that continue the process of breaking down food into a usable form. Cells in the lining of the stomach secrete strong acid and powerful enzymes that are responsible for the breakdown process. When the contents of the stomach are sufficiently processed, they are released into the small intestine.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n164\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSmall intestine\\n\\nMade up of three segments — the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum — the small intestine is an approximately 7 meter (app. 22.5 foot) long muscular tube that breaks down food using enzymes released by the pancreas and bile from the liver. Peristalsis also is at work in this organ, moving food through and mixing it with digestive secretions from the pancreas and liver. The duodenum is largely responsible for the continuous breaking-down process, with the jejunum and ileum mainly responsible for absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.\\n\\nContents of the small intestine start out semi-solid, digested on the way and end in a more liquid form after passing through the organ. Water, bile, enzymes, and mucous contribute to the change in consistency. Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the leftover- food residue liquid has passed through the small intestine, it then moves on to the large intestine, or colon.\\n\\n(cid:1) Pancreas\\n\\nThe pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. These enzymes break down protein, fats, and carbohydrates. The pancreas also makes insulin, secreting it directly into the bloodstream. Insulin is the chief hormone for metabolizing sugar.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLiver\\n\\nThe liver has multiple functions, but its main function within the digestive system is to process the nutrients absorbed from the small intestine. Bile from the gall bladder (liver) secreted into the small intestine also plays an important role in digesting fat. In addition, the liver is the body’s “chemical factory.\" It takes the raw materials absorbed by the intestine and makes all the various chemicals the body needs to function. The liver also detoxifies potentially harmful substances. It breaks down and secretes many substances.\\n\\n(cid:1) Gallbladder\\n\\nThe gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, and then releases it into the duodenum to help absorb and digest fats.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n165\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLarge intestine (colon)\\n\\nThe colon is an approximately 1.5 meter (app. 60 inches) long muscular tube that connects the small intestine to the rectum. The large intestine is made up of the cecum, the ascending (right) colon, the transverse (across) colon, the descending (left) colon, and the sigmoid colon, which connects to the rectum. The appendix is a small tube attached to the cecum. The large intestine is a highly specialized organ that is responsible for processing waste so that emptying the bowels is easy and convenient.\\n\\nStool, or waste left over from the digestive process, is passed through the colon by means of peristalsis, first in a liquid state and ultimately in a semi-solid/solid form. As stool passes through the colon, water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a \"mass movement\" empties it into the rectum once or twice a day. It normally takes about 36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. These bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins, processing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful bacteria. When the descending colon becomes full of stool, also called faeces, it empties its contents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination.\\n\\n(cid:1) Rectum\\n\\nThe rectum is 18 to 20 cm (app. 8-inch) chamber that connects the colon to the anus. It is the rectum\\'s job to receive stool from the colon, to let the person know that there is stool to be evacuated, and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or stool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides if the rectal contents can be released or not. If they can, the sphincters relax and the rectum contracts, disposing of its contents. If the contents cannot be disposed of, the sphincter contracts and the rectum accommodates so that the sensation temporarily goes away.\\n\\n(cid:1) Anus\\n\\nThe anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It is a 3 to 5 cm (app 2-inch) long canal consisting of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external). The lining of the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents. It lets the person know whether the contents are liquid, gas, or solid. The anus is surrounded by sphincter muscles that are important in allowing control of stool movement. The pelvic floor muscles create\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n166\\n\\nan angle between the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it is not supposed to. The internal sphincter is always tight, except when stool enters the rectum. It keeps us continent when we are asleep or otherwise unaware of the presence of stool. When we get an urge to go to the bathroom, we rely on our external sphincter to hold the stool until reaching a toilet, where it then relaxes to release the contents.\\n\\nA well balanced diet contains carbohydrates, proteins, fat, minerals (ea. iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, fluorine, iodine, zinc, copper etc.) and vitamins.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n167\\n\\nG.2\\n\\nDIARRHOEA\\n\\nDiarrhoea is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms.\\n\\nA person can catch this infection by:\\n\\n(cid:1) drinking contaminated water;\\n\\n(cid:1) preparing food with contaminated water;\\n\\n(cid:1) eating unsafe food, such as fish that was caught in polluted water;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfood that has not been kept cold or has gone bad;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntouching faeces; or\\n\\n(cid:1) not washing his hands.\\n\\nDiarrhoea causes dehydration as too much water and nutrition leaves the body. If the sick person does not receive help, he can die. Babies and children are most at risk of dehydration.\\n\\nIf both fever and diarrhoea occur together, laypersons often focus on fever only and not enough attention is paid to replacing lost fluids due to diarrhoea.\\n\\nA sick person with diarrhoea does not normally need antibiotics, unless prescribed by a doctor.\\n\\nG.2.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou may observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person has frequent loose or liquid stools.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person has an urgent need to defecate and might have trouble to keep it under control. Even after defecation person may complain of feeling of incomplete evacuation.\\n\\n(cid:1) Often the sick person complains about pain in the abdomen (cramps).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe abdomen might appear bloated or tense.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person complains of feeling unwell.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFever might be present.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be nausea and/or vomiting.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person might be passing blood and/or mucus in stool.\\n\\nG.2.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nG.2.2.1\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\n1. Wash your hands before taking care of the sick person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol- based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n2. Use gloves to protect yourself. If no gloves are available, you can use a clean plastic bag.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n168\\n\\nTry not to come in contact with the person’s stool or vomit.\\n\\nG.2.3\\n\\nPREVENT DEHYDRATION\\n\\n3. Prevent dehydration by giving plenty of fluids to the sick person. Ask the sick person to drink the equivalent of what he lost every time he passes loose stools:\\n\\nOn an average, a person should drink 5-10 ml/kg body weight per loose stool.\\n\\na. Children under two years old should drink between a quarter and half of a\\n\\nlarge cup (50-100 ml) each time they pass loose stools.\\n\\nb. Children between 2-10 years should drink between a half and a full large cup\\n\\n(100-200 ml) each time they pass loose stools.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n169\\n\\nc. Children above ten years and adults should at least drink one large cup (200\\n\\nml) each time they pass loose stools.\\n\\nd. Feed the sick child more frequently.\\n\\nTell the mother to continue to give breast feeding with a higher frequency.\\n\\nTell the mother to continue to give bottle feeding (for bottle-fed children only) with a higher frequency. Use the same milk as usual.\\n\\n4. Advice the sick person to avoid fruit juices.\\n\\n5. Let the sick person drink (if available) ORS (package bought at chemist or available at Govt. healthcare facilities free of cost).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n170\\n\\nPrepare and use as instructed on package.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf no ORS is available, you can prepare a homemade sugar and salt solution:\\n\\na. Take one litre of safe clean water (boiled and cooled clean water).\\n\\nb. Add eight teaspoons of sugar.\\n\\nc. Add one teaspoon of salt.\\n\\nd. Mix well.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf the sick person also vomits, wait five to ten minutes before giving another drink. Then ask the person to drink slowly or give it by spoon.\\n\\n8. You may give the sick person curd (if available).\\n\\n9. The sick person can eat light food.\\n\\n10. If a person has to travel, provide drinks so that he can take in fluids on the way.\\n\\n11. Advise for regularly check on the sick person and to seek medical help if his condition worsens. This includes passing blood and mucus in stool, having fever, developing dehydration, or if diarrhoea does not get better within 2 days.\\n\\nG.2.3.1\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nWash your hands after taking care of the sick person or if you came into contact with stools or vomit or you used the toilet. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nG.2.4 WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nThe person should seek medical help if having any of the following symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1) has blood in the stool,\\n\\n(cid:1) has fever,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n171\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsuffers from severe sleepiness or is difficult to wake up or is confused,\\n\\n(cid:1) urinates less and the colour of the urine darkens,\\n\\n(cid:1) has sunken eyes,\\n\\n(cid:1) cries without tears,\\n\\n(cid:1) has a dry mouth,\\n\\n(cid:1) does not drink,\\n\\n(cid:1) has repeated vomiting,\\n\\n(cid:1) has fits,\\n\\n(cid:1) has fast breathing, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe diarrhoea does not get better within two days.\\n\\nWhen transporting the person to a healthcare facility, provide drinks so that he can take in fluids on the way.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n172\\n\\nG.3\\n\\nFOOD POISONING\\n\\nUsually people loosely refer to all cases of gastroenteritis (vomiting, diarrhoea) caused by contaminated food as having food poisoning. Infectious organisms including viruses, bacteria and parasites are the most common causes of food poisoning. Contamination can occur at any point of production, processing, handling, storage, or cooking. The person may become sick in a few hours to several days after eating the contaminated food. These cases can be managed as other cases of diarrhoea.\\n\\nSometimes, food is directly contaminated by toxins, for example toxins released by Staphylococci or Clostridium bacteria. In such cases, the person usually becomes unwell very soon after consuming the food and the main symptom is vomiting. Some consider cases caused by food contaminated by a toxin as having true food poisoning. These cases need to be referred to the hospital urgently for proper management.\\n\\nG.3.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou may observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person has nausea or vomits.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person complains about cramping and abdominal pain.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person has diarrhoea.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person might complain of a headache.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere might be fever.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe sick person might have impaired consciousness.\\n\\nSeveral people sharing the contaminated food fall ill at the same time, as in a marriage.\\n\\nG.3.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nG.3.2.1\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\n1.

This condition is sometimes referred to as ‘pre-diabetes’. If the blood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing ‘full-blown’ diabetes is increased.\\n\\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nG.4.1\\n\\nTYPE 1 DIABETES\\n\\nIn type 1 diabetes, the body\\'s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As no insulin is produced, the glucose level increases, which can seriously damage the body\\'s organs. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for the rest of their life.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes. It\\'s also sometimes known as juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes when it develops in young persons, often during the teenage years.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nG.4.2\\n\\nTYPE 2 DIABETES\\n\\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn\\'t produce enough insulin, or the body\\'s cells don\\'t respond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1 diabetes.\\n\\nPeople diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be able to control the symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring their blood glucose levels frequently.\\n\\nHowever, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets and/or injections.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity. It is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset\\n\\ndiabetes because it\\'s more common in older people.\\n\\nG.4.3\\n\\nGESTATIONAL DIABETES (DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY)\\n\\nDuring pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to convert it into energy. This is known as gestational diabetes.\\n\\nPregnancy can also make existing type 1 diabetes worse. Gestational diabetes can increase the risk of health problems developing in an unborn baby, so it\\'s important to keep the blood glucose levels under control.\\n\\nIn most cases, gestational diabetes develops during the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks 14 to 26) and usually disappears after the baby is born. However, women who have gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n176\\n\\nG.4.4\\n\\nDIAGNOSIS\\n\\nIt is very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. Symptoms such as feeling thirsty, hungry and passing urine more often than usual, losing weight and muscle bulk, having wounds that heal slowly, experiencing blurred vision or feeling tired all the time might indicate a person suffers from diabetes and this person should contact a healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n177\\n\\nG.5\\n\\nHYPERGLYCAEMIA\\n\\nA too high level of blood sugar, called hyperglycaemia occurs when the body can\\'t remove glucose from the blood and turn it into energy. It usually only happens in people with diabetes because people with this condition have problems with insulin – the hormone that helps remove glucose from the blood and converts it to energy.\\n\\nIf you have diabetes, there are some situations that can trigger an increase in blood glucose including infections, stress, missing a dose of insulin, eating too much or being ill.\\n\\nG.5.1\\n\\nSYMPTOMS OF HYPERGLYCAEMIC COMA OR DIABETIC COMA\\n\\nImmediate medical attention is required if a person with diabetes, experiences the following symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea or vomiting;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nstomach pain;\\n\\n(cid:1) a fruity smell on the breath, which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish;\\n\\n(cid:1) drowsiness or confusion;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrapid breathing (hyperventilation);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsigns of dehydration (signs of which include a headache, dry skin, and a weak, rapid heartbeat);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nloss of consciousness.\\n\\nThese symptoms may be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious and potentially life- threatening complication of hyperglycaemia.\\n\\nG.5.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nG.5.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST\\n\\n1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders.\\n\\nG.5.2.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n2. The person urgently needs help. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.

Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nG.5.3 WHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility as a diabetic coma is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n179\\n\\nG.6\\n\\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA\\n\\nHypoglycaemia, or also known as a \"hypo\", is an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. When the glucose level is too low, the body doesn\\'t have enough energy to carry out its activities.\\n\\nHypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes taking too much insulin (overdoses insulin) or other medicines, missing a meal or exercises too hard.\\n\\nPeople who do not have diabetes can also experience hypoglycaemia, although this is much rarer. It can be triggered by malnutrition, binge drinking or certain other conditions.\\n\\nG.6.1\\n\\nSYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCAEMIA\\n\\nMost people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, dizziness, and sweating.\\n\\nIn more severe cases, there can also be confusion and difficulty in concentration. In severe cases, the person experiencing hypoglycaemia may lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt is also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.\\n\\nG.6.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nG.6.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST\\n\\n1. Make sure there is no danger to you, the person or bystanders.\\n\\nG.6.2.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n2. Make the person lie down in a comfortable position.\\n\\n3 . Ask if the person is taking insulin and/or other medicines for diabetes and if he might have taken too much insulin and/or other medicines, missed a meal or have done a heavy physical exercise.\\n\\n4 . If the person is conscious and is able to follow commands and can swallow, give the sick person some food or drink that contains sugar, such as sweets, jam, or dextrose tablets or fruit juice.\\n\\nOften the diabetic patient has fast acting sugars such as biscuits available with them. Allow him to take it.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n180\\n\\nAfter having something sugary, suggest the person to have a longer-acting \"starchy\" carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits or a sandwich.\\n\\n5. Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who is drowsy or unconscious, as he could choke\\n\\n6. Keep observing the person in case he collapses.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf you cannot differentiate between hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia (which is difficult even for a trained person), treat the patient as having hypoglycaemia. Low blood sugar can kill a person quickly.\\n\\nG.6.2.2.1 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THE PERSON BECOMES UNCONSCIOUS, BUT IS STILL BREATHING?\\n\\na. Put the person in the recovery position.\\n\\nb.

Keratinocytes produce the protein known as keratin, the main component of the epidermis. Melanocytes produce the skin pigment, known as melanin. Langerhans cells prevent things from getting into the skin.\\n\\nH.1.2\\n\\nTHE MIDDLE LAYER: DERMIS\\n\\nThe dermis is a complex combination of blood vessels, hair follicles, and sebaceous (oil) glands. Here, you’ll find collagen and elastin, two proteins offering the skin’s support and elasticity. Fibroblasts are the cells that synthesize collagen and elastin.\\n\\nThis layer also contains pain and touch receptors.\\n\\nIt is this layer that is responsible for wrinkles.\\n\\nH.1.3\\n\\nTHE FATTY LAYER: HYPODERMIS\\n\\nThis layer is also known as the subcutis.\\n\\nIt hosts sweat glands, and fat and collagen cells, and is responsible for conserving your body’s heat and protecting your vital inner organs.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n183\\n\\nH.2\\n\\nSKIN FUNCTIONS\\n\\nThe main functions of the skin are protection, sensation, temperature regulation, immunity, allowing movement and growth, excretion and synthesis of vitamins.\\n\\nH.2.1\\n\\nPROTECTION\\n\\nThe skin is a natural barrier between the inside of the body and its surrounding environment. The skin protects against dehydration, UV light, microorganisms and physical trauma.\\n\\nH.2.2\\n\\nSENSATION\\n\\nThe pain and touch receptors in the dermis allow us to feel touch, pressure, heat, cold and pain.\\n\\nH.2.3\\n\\nTEMPERATURE REGULATION\\n\\nThe optimal temperature for the human body is 36 to 37 degrees Celsius (or 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit). A section of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the body’s thermoregulation. It issues instructions to muscles, organs, glands, and nervous system when it senses the core internal temperature is becoming too low or too high.\\n\\nOne of the major functions of the skin is to help to maintain the body temperature.\\n\\nH.2.3.1.1 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY WARM?\\n\\nWhen the body becomes too cold, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface narrow (constrict) to keep the warm blood in the core of the body. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is reduced and the hairs stand on end to keep warm air close to the skin. Shivering is a method to generate heat by involuntary muscle activity.\\n\\nH.2.3.1.2 HOW THE SKIN HELPS TO KEEP THE BODY COLD?\\n\\nWhen the body becomes too hot, blood vessels at the body’s skin surface widen (dilate) to loose heat by the increased blood flow. The activity of the sweat glands in the skin is turned up to create more sweat, which cools down the skin as it evaporates.\\n\\nH.2.4\\n\\nIMMUNITY\\n\\nSeveral types of skin cells (e.g. Langerhans cells, phagocytic cells, epidermal dendritic cells) are responsible for the destruction of microorganisms or are involved in the interaction of the skin with the body\\'s immune system.\\n\\nH.2.5\\n\\nALLOWS GROWTH AND MOVEMENT\\n\\nThe elasticity of the skin allows growth, movement and adaptation of the contours of the body during movement.\\n\\nH.2.6\\n\\nEXCRETION\\n\\nThe body releases waste products from the body via the surface of the skin, regulated by the volume and composition of sweat (e.g. excretion of water, urea, ammonia and uric acid).\\n\\nH.2.7\\n\\nSYNTHESIS OF VITAMINS\\n\\nThe skin plays an important role in the synthesis of vitamin D.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n184\\n\\nH.3\\n\\nBURN WOUNDS\\n\\nBurns are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue that result from the sun, heat sources, fire, hot items, boiling liquids, chemicals, irradiation, etc. However, cold can also create burn wounds!\\n\\nH.3.1\\n\\nFIRST, SECOND AND THIRD DEGREE BURNS\\n\\nBurns are classified by the degree of skin and underlying tissues that are damaged. You will observe different signs and symptoms according to the severity of the burn wound.\\n\\nH.3.1.1\\n\\nFIRST DEGREE BURNS\\n\\nSuperficial first degree burns show following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nred or darker than usual skin;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nslightly swollen skin;\\n\\n(cid:1) painful, but mostly bearable.\\n\\nThese burns usually extend only into the epidermis.\\n\\nH.3.1.2\\n\\nSECOND DEGREE BURNS\\n\\nIntermediate second degree burns show following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1) blistering,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling,\\n\\n(cid:1) very painful.\\n\\nThese burns usually involve the epidermis and the dermis.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n185\\n\\nH.3.1.3\\n\\nTHIRD DEGREE BURNS\\n\\nDeep third degree burns show following signs and symptoms\\n\\n(cid:1) black, parchment-like or white-looking burn wound;\\n\\n(cid:1) mostly dry;\\n\\n(cid:1) no pain inside the third degree area, but very painful in the surrounding second\\n\\nand first degree burned parts of the skin.\\n\\nH.3.2\\n\\nTYPE OF BURNS BY ORIGIN\\n\\nBurns can be differentiated by their origin:\\n\\nH.3.2.1\\n\\nDRY BURNS\\n\\nDry burns are burns from flames, contacts with hot objects (e.g. hot cigarettes, hot domestic appliances) or friction (e.g. rope burns).\\n\\nH.3.2.2\\n\\nSCALDS\\n\\nScalds are burns by steam or hot liquids (e.g. tea, coffee, hot fat).\\n\\nH.3.2.3\\n\\nELECTRICAL BURNS\\n\\nElectrical burns are burns caused by electrical current. These burns can result from low voltage current (e.g. home appliances) or high voltage current (e.g. transformers) or by lightning strikes.\\n\\nH.3.2.4\\n\\nCHEMICAL BURNS\\n\\nExposure to chemical substances like industrial chemicals, corrosive gases or inhaled chemical fumes can cause chemical burns. Also, the exposure to domestic chemicals and agents as paint stripper, caustic soda, weed killers, bleach, oven cleaners or strong acids or alkali can cause burns.\\n\\nH.3.2.5\\n\\nRADIATION BURNS\\n\\nExposure to radioactive sources, e.g. X-rays or radiotherapy-rays, can result in radiation burns.\\n\\nH.3.2.6\\n\\nFROST BITES (COLD BURNS)\\n\\nCold burns like frost bites originate from exposure to cold wind, cold temperature or contact with cold freezing materials (e.g. cold metal), or can happen from contact with freezing vapours (e.g. liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n186\\n\\nH.3.2.7\\n\\nSUN BURNS\\n\\nIntensive exposure to sunlight, an over-exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) from a sunlamp or the sun result in sun burns.\\n\\nLong exposure to heat or hot weather can also lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\\n\\nH.3.3\\n\\nDANGER OF BURNS\\n\\nSevere or large burn injuries can pose serious problems. However, any burn injury can lead to complications.\\n\\nThe danger from burns usually depends more on the area of the burns rather than the degree. Superficial burns over a large area of the body are more dangerous than the complete charring of a part of the limb. It must be noted that a burn is mostly a mixture itself of different degrees of burns, and that in the same person different degrees of burns may show on different parts of the body.\\n\\nThe most important dangers are:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInfection\\n\\nBurn injuries leave the skin open and susceptible to infection. Burn injuries also increase your risk of sepsis, which is a life- threatening infection that rapidly travels through the bloodstream. Sepsis can cause shock and organ failure.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLow blood volume\\n\\nBurn injuries damage the skin and the blood vessels, causing fluids to escape the body. This can result in low blood volume, known as hypovolemia. A severe loss of fluid and blood can prevent the heart from pumping enough blood through the body (resulting in shock).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLow body temperature\\n\\nThe skin helps to control the body\\'s temperature. When a large portion of the skin is injured, the body loses heat. This increases the risk of hypothermia — i.e. when the body loses heat faster than it can produce – resulting in a dangerously low body temperature.\\n\\n(cid:1) Breathing difficulties\\n\\nOne of the most common dangers that accompany burn injuries is the inhalation of smoke or hot air. This can burn the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Smoke can permanently damage the lungs and lead to respiratory failure.\\n\\n(cid:1) Pain\\n\\nBurn wounds are very painful.\\n\\n(cid:1) Disability\\n\\nBurn injuries form scar tissue once healed. When the skin is burned, the surrounding skin starts to pull together resulting in a post-burn contracture that prevents movement. Deeper burns can limit movement of the bones or joints when skin, muscles or tendons shorten and tighten, permanently pulling joints out of position.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n187\\n\\nH.3.4\\n\\nDRY BURNS AND SCALDS (BURNS FROM FLAMES, HOT SURFACES, STEAM, …)\\n\\nH.3.4.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty has first, second and/or third degree burn wounds.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIn case of burns to the face or inhalation of hot air or smoke, you may also observe:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsoot around the mouth or nose, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nscorched eyebrows, eyelashes, moustache, beard or hair\\n\\nH.3.4.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nH.3.4.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND SEEK HELP\\n\\n1. Make sure the situation is safe for yourself and (if possible) for the victim.\\n\\n2. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured.\\n\\nH.3.4.2.2 RESCUING A PERSON FROM A FIRE:\\n\\nThe fire brigade is equipped and trained to rescue people from fires. It is their duty and is not the primary duty of a first aider. However, in the exceptional case you need to rescue a person from a fire yourself, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n3. Make sure you have already called for help prior entering the location.\\n\\n4. Have a wet handkerchief/cloth around your face. Crawl along the floor to reach and pull out the casualty as most clean air will be at lower level.\\n\\n5. Act swiftly and quickly because there might be some amount of carbon monoxide also in the room. A wet handkerchief and crawling on the floor will not protect you from it.\\n\\n6. Do not open other doors or windows when there is fire in the room. The rush of air will increase the fire.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n188\\n\\nH.3.4.2.3\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf the person’s cloths are on fire:\\n\\na. stop him from running around;\\n\\nb. douse the fire with water;\\n\\nc. approach the person whilst holding a rug, heavy blanket, coat or cotton table cover in front of you and wrap him in it to smother the flames, or\\n\\nd. make the person roll on the ground to smother the flames.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n189\\n\\n8. Cooling with water will prevent the burn from going deeper and will reduce the pain.\\n\\nPour water on the burn for 10-15 minutes or until the burn stops hurting.\\n\\nDo not use very cold water for cooling the burns. Burn victims can easily become hypothermic.\\n\\n9. Protect the burn victim by wrapping him in clean blankets.\\n\\n10. If possible, wash your hands before taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n11. Put on gloves if available. You can also use a clean plastic bag.\\n\\nTry not to touch the person’s wounds.\\n\\n12. Cover burn wounds with a clean cotton cloth.\\n\\n13. Do not open blisters – leave them intact.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n190\\n\\n14. Remove any clothing or jewellery that is not stuck to the burned skin.\\n\\nDo not remove parts of clothing or jewellery that are attached to the burn wounds.\\n\\n15. If possible, remove the person’s belt, shoes or boots as the limb might swell.\\n\\n16. Keep the casualty warm, but do not overheat him.\\n\\n17. If possible, keep burned hands, legs or feet in an elevated position.\\n\\n18. Do not leave the casualty alone, and keep observing him.\\n\\n19.

Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nH.3.4.3 WHEN TO REFER A BURN VICTIM TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY OR HOSPITAL?\\n\\nAlways arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility and seek medical help straight away in a healthcare facility or hospital if:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person is under five years old or over 65 years old;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burn is on the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, the sexual organs or joints;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burn circles the entire limb, body or neck;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burn is equal or larger than the injured persons hand size;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burn looks black, white, papery, hard and dry;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person has a decreased or no sense of feeling in or around the wound;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burns were caused by electricity, chemicals or high pressure steam;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe injured person has inhaled flames or hot air, or breathed in a lot of smoke;\\n\\n(cid:1) clothing or jewellery is stuck to the skin;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe victim suffers any other serious trauma due to the accident;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe victim suffers from a medical condition, like diabetes; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe person’s condition is getting worse.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n192\\n\\nH.3.5\\n\\nCARE OF MINOR BURNS (SMALL FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS)\\n\\nFor minor burns (small first and second degree burns) you can use fresh aloe vera or honey if available to cover the burn wound. This will help the wound to heal faster.\\n\\nH.3.5.1\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\n1. Wash your hands before taking care of the sick person. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol- based sanitizers can also be used, if available. Use gloves to protect yourself. If no gloves are available, you can use a clean plastic bag. Try not to come in contact with the person’s vomit, stools or fluids.\\n\\nH.3.5.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\nAfter cooling down the burn wound (see above on how to approach the casualty):\\n\\n2. Dress the wound with a clean cotton cloth.\\n\\n3. Do not apply any medicine to the burns.\\n\\nDo not apply cotton wool to cover the burns.\\n\\nDo not use Vaseline to cover the burns.\\n\\nDo not apply any pastes or creams to the burns.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n193\\n\\n4. Make sure the burned casualty has sufficient fluids to drink.\\n\\n5. Refer the victim to a healthcare facility for further management.\\n\\nH.3.5.3 WHEN TO REFER A BURN VICTIM TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY OR HOSPITAL?\\n\\nAlways refer the victim to a healthcare facility for further management.\\n\\nAdvise the injured person to seek medical care if in the days after:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe burn smells bad,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthere is any discharge from the wound or the wound is soaked with pus,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe pain remains or increases,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthere is swelling, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nif he gets fever.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n194\\n\\nH.3.6\\n\\nSPECIFIC BURN LOCATIONS\\n\\nH.3.6.1\\n\\nBURNS TO THE FACE\\n\\nThe casualty having burned in the face or breathed in hot air or smoke, may experience difficulty in breathing:\\n\\n(cid:1) Approach the casualty as described for burns and scalds.\\n\\n(cid:1) Allow the casualty to take a position that allows him to breathe best and is most\\n\\ncomfortable.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLoosen clothing that might hinder easy breathing.\\n\\n(cid:1) Especially observe the casualty’s breathing and start CPR, if required.\\n\\n(cid:1) Always transport these burn victims urgently to a healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\nH.3.6.2\\n\\nBURNS TO THE EYE\\n\\nFlames or hot substances may have burned the eye(s).\\n\\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nscorched eyebrows, eyelashes;\\n\\n(cid:1) burn wounds around the eye; or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nred eyes with burning and itching sensation.\\n\\nIn case of burns to the eye:\\n\\n1. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured.\\n\\n2. Rinse the eye immediately with plenty of water for 10-15 minutes, preferably from the nose outwards.\\n\\nUse clean water or water that has been boiled and cooled. Be careful: Room temperature water is more comfortable than cold water. Very warm water might burn the eye.\\n\\nMake sure no liquid or rinsing water runs into the other eye.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf the person wears contact lenses, ask the person to take them out and keep them in a safe place.\\n\\n4. Arrange transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n195\\n\\n5. Do not put medication into the eye.\\n\\n6. Eye injuries have to be managed always with great care. Always refer these victims to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\nH.3.7\\n\\nELECTRICAL BURNS AND ELECTROCUTION BY ELECTRICITY OR LIGHTNING\\n\\nElectrical burns are caused when electricity passes through the body.\\n\\nThe electricity source may be e.g. lightning or contact with household current, high voltage cables or transformers, or low voltage - high ampere electricity from a car, truck or tractor battery. Do not touch the casualty till the power switch has been turned off.\\n\\nThe electricity enters the body at the point of contact, goes through the body and exits at the point where the body touches the ground or at earth point. Often burn wounds may be observed at these entry and exit points. But inside the body the electricity can cause damage on its track that remains hidden.\\n\\nExposure to electricity can also cause cardiac arrest.\\n\\nH.3.7.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs and symptoms might be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1) Based on the situation you may be able to detect there has been an electrocution accident (e.g. you notice an electrical appliance connected to the electrical net next to the casualty, a high voltage wire might be next to the casualty, thunderstorm, …).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe casualty may:\\n\\n(cid:1) be unconscious,\\n\\n(cid:1) have difficulty in breathing or have stopped breathing,\\n\\n(cid:1) be in cardiac arrest (no beating heart) or have an irregular pulse,\\n\\n(cid:1) have burn wounds, or\\n\\n(cid:1) have muscle spasms.\\n\\nH.3.7.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nH.3.7.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST AND CALL FOR HELP\\n\\n1.

In case of high voltage currents, never try to move the wire or source of electricity away from the victim. High voltage current (+ 1000 Volt) can jump and kill up to 18 metres. Wait till the high voltage source has been turned off prior approaching the victim.\\n\\nb. In case of electrocution by home electricity (220V) and if you cannot switch off the electric source, you may try move the source away from both you and the injured person using a dry, non-conducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood.\\n\\nc. In case of strike of lightning, make sure you and the victim stay safe. If you are at risk from ongoing lightning, wait until danger has passed. If possible stay inside a house or in a car.\\n\\n3. Shout or call for help if you are alone but do not leave the person unattended. Ask a bystander to seek help or to arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital. Tell him to come back to you to confirm if help has been secured.\\n\\nH.3.7.2.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n4. Try not to move the casualty, except if he is in immediate danger.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n197\\n\\n5. Cool down the burn wounds. Use clean water. If there is no clean water available, use the available water.\\n\\nOnly do this, if there is no danger of further electrocution: make sure the current has been switched off.\\n\\na. Pour water on the burn for 10-15 minutes or until the burn stops hurting.\\n\\nb. Do not use very cold water for cooling the burns. Burn victims can easily\\n\\nbecome hypothermic.\\n\\n6. Protect the burn victim by wrapping him in a clean sheet of cloth or blankets.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIf possible, wash your hands before taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n8. Put on gloves if available. You can also use a clean plastic bag.

It is caused by the exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. When UV B rays penetrate the deeper skin layers damage to the cells occurs. The skin becomes red and painful. In some cases the damage to the cells is so severe resulting in skin peeling and blistering.\\n\\nStrong or cool wind or a body covered by water or sweat might give the sunbathing person a falsely reassuring effect of not being sunburned. As clouds have less limiting effect on UV radiation than they do on temperature, sunburns still can happen on cloudy days. White surfaces such as snow or sand reflect UV radiation and so increase the risk of sunburn. Rippling water and rough sea reflect more UV radiation than calm open water. Sunlight has a shorter distance to travel in order to reach the earth’s surface in areas closer to the tropics; UV radiation levels will therefore, be higher in these areas because there is less dissipation of the rays as they travel to earth. The level of UV radiation also increases with altitude as the atmosphere becomes thinner and there is less absorption of the radiation.\\n\\nH.3.9.1.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs and symptoms may be observed when a person suffers a sunburn:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nreddened skin,\\n\\n(cid:1) warm skin, and\\n\\n(cid:1) pain of varying degrees.\\n\\nIn more severe cases:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling,\\n\\n(cid:1) blistering, and\\n\\n(cid:1) weeping skin.\\n\\nH.3.9.1.2 WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n1. Bring the casualty to a shaded cool place. If this is not possible, cover the skin with light clothing or a towel.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n204\\n\\n2. Cool down the skin by sponging or by slowly showering for about 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to overcool the casualty: do not use too cold water.\\n\\n3. Encourage the casualty to have frequent sips of cool water (this is an exception to the standard first aid guideline of not giving a casualty to drink or to eat).\\n\\n4. For severe burns, refer the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nFor minor burns, an after-sun cream may be applied.\\n\\n5. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands.

Or a dehydrated person may not be able to sweat fast enough to dissipate heat, which causes the body temperature to rise. Heat regulation mechanism fails during heatstroke.\\n\\nHeatstroke is a form of hyperthermia, an abnormally elevated body temperature with accompanying physical and neurological symptoms. Heatstroke is a true medical emergency that can be fatal if not properly and promptly treated.

Causes can be exposure to extreme cold weather, wearing inadequate or wet clothing, or wind chill. The poor blood circulation caused by too tight clothing or boots, staying in a cramped position, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels, such as diabetes may enhance the process.\\n\\nFrostbites can affect any part of your body. However, the extremities, such as the hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected as the body is constricting circulation to extremities on its own to preserve core temperature and fight hypothermia.\\n\\nThe symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If exposure to the cold continues, the person may feel pins and needles before the area becomes numb as the tissues freeze.\\n\\nPeople with a history of severe frostbite often report after effects of frostbite. These can include:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nincreased sensitivity to cold;\\n\\n(cid:1) numbness in the affected body parts, most commonly the fingers;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nreduced sense of touch in the affected body parts; and\\n\\n(cid:1) persistent pain in the affected body parts.\\n\\nH.6.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nYou may observe following signs and symptoms:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of feeling pins and needles, throbbing or aching in the affected area.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe skin feels cold, numb and white.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person may feel a tingling sensation.\\n\\nIf the frostbite is more advanced:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe affected area may feel hard and frozen;\\n\\n(cid:1) when the person is out of the cold:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe tissue is thawed out (defrosted and becomes soft);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe skin will turn red and blister, which can be painful;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthere may also be swelling and itching.\\n\\nIf the exposure to the cold continues and the frostbite develops further:\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n212\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe skin becomes white, blue or blotchy, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe tissue underneath feels hard and cold to touch.\\n\\nWhen the person is out of the cold and the skin thaws (defrosts):\\n\\nblood-filled blisters form and turn into thick black scabs. At this stage, it is likely that some tissue has died. This is known as tissue necrosis, and the tissue may have to be removed to prevent infection.\\n\\nH.6.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nH.6.2.1\\n\\nSAFETY FIRST\\n\\n1. Make sure you are protected sufficiently against the cold, prior helping the other person\\n\\nH.6.2.2\\n\\nPROVIDE FIRST AID\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf possible, move the victim to a warmer place.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIt is best that the person avoids to walk on frostbitten toes and feet as this can cause further damage, although in emergency situations this may not always be possible.\\n\\n4. Replace wet clothing with soft, dry clothing to stop further heat loss.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n213\\n\\n5. Gently remove gloves, rings, and other constrictions, such as boots.\\n\\n6. The affected areas need to be re-warmed.\\n\\nDo not try to do this until you are out of the cold. If the warming process is started and the frozen parts are re-exposed to the cold, it can cause further irreversible damage.\\n\\nYou can warm the affected part with your hands, in your lap, or in the person’s armpits.\\n\\n7. Do not rub the affected area as this can damage the skin and other tissues and do more harm than benefit.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n214\\n\\n8. Do not apply direct heat (such as from a fire or heater) as this can cause further injury.\\n\\n9. Re-warming should last at least 30 minutes and should only be stopped once the affected body part has a red-purple colour and can be easily moved.\\n\\n10. Do not allow the person to smoke as this can affect blood circulation.\\n\\n11. After the frostbitten area has been thawed, it should be wrapped very gently in clean bandages, with the fingers and toes separated. It is very important to keep the skin clean to avoid infection. Wash your hands prior bandaging the frostbites.\\n\\n12. Too much movement should be avoided, and the limbs should be elevated if possible. Ask the person not to walk on affected parts that have been re-warmed as the tissues will be very delicate.\\n\\n13. Refer the person with frostbites to a healthcare facility.\\n\\nTransport the person to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital in case of advanced frostbites.\\n\\nH.6.2.3\\n\\nHYGIENE\\n\\nWash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nH.6.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAlways urgently transport the person suffering severe frostbites to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nA person with minor frostbites should also always be referred to a healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n215\\n\\nH.7\\n\\nPREVENTION OF BURNS\\n\\nBurn injuries can be caused by cooking accidents, house fires, electrical faults, candles, incense, or children accessing fire or heat sources.\\n\\nBurn wounds cause a lot of pain, scars, deformities and even death. Burn injuries can easily be prevented by simply following simple precautions:\\n\\nTeach and protect the children:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTeach children about household objects that can burn them, could cause fire and explain the danger of fire to them.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not leave children alone near heat sources, hot water, or open fires.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInstall fences around open fires to discourage children from standing too close.\\n\\n(cid:1) Hot drinks and liquids should be kept out of reach of young children.\\n\\n(cid:1) Cover the electric points properly.\\n\\nCooking & heating:\\n\\n(cid:1) Ensure that gas cylinders do not leak.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSwitch off the gas supply after the work is over.\\n\\n(cid:1) Designate a specific cooking area, for example by making a raised stove with a\\n\\nmud barrier when you cook outside.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe safest cooking height is when the cooking area is raised to a height that allows cooking whilst standing.\\n\\n(cid:1) Keep children out of cooking areas.\\n\\n(cid:1) Never leave food unattended on a stove.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTurn the pot and pan handles towards the back of the stove when cooking, so that children can’t accidently knock them over.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not leave spoons or utensils in pots when cooking.\\n\\n(cid:1) Only handle pots and pans with the insulated handles, or use cloth or other\\n\\nprotective material before touching the handle.\\n\\n(cid:1) Avoid wearing clothing that could easily catch fire whilst cooking.

Test the temperature of the water before putting children in the bath tub. Your water geysers should be set at 49-54 °C (120-130 °F).\\n\\nChemical and inflammable products\\n\\n(cid:1) Never store flammable products in the proximity of a heat source.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nStore chemical, flammable or corrosive products safely out of the reach of children.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nStore chemical products at the eye level of an adult person; higher placed items are more difficult to reach and might spill over you when reaching for them.\\n\\n(cid:1) Be careful when handling chemical products – they can create burn wounds when\\n\\nspilled on the skin, face or eyes.\\n\\n(cid:1) Use the right containers to store chemicals in and label them.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not reuse old bottles of drinks for storage of chemicals.\\n\\nHeat:\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not stay too long in direct sunlight.\\n\\n(cid:1) Drink water and liquids frequently, especially in hot weather.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n217\\n\\nCold:\\n\\n(cid:1) Protect head, face, hands and feet when in cold weather or cold wind.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not consume alcohol when going out into the cold.\\n\\nExits:\\n\\n(cid:1) Make an escape plan.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not block (fire) exits.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n218\\n\\nH.8\\n\\nFEVER\\n\\nA fever is a temporary increase in the body temperature. Fever can be a sign of serious illness. Any person with fever needs medical attention to determine the cause. Fever caused by malaria, typhoid, pneumonia (lung infection) etc., can be very dangerous if they are left untreated and can lead to death.\\n\\nThe normal body temperature is around 37 °C (98.6 °F). Fever is generally agreed to be present if the temperature is above 37.7 °C (100 °F).\\n\\nFollowing set points are used to identify fever:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf the temperature in the anus (anal/rectal) is at or over 38.0 °C (100.4 °F).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf the temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.7 °C (100 °F).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf the temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 37.2 °C (99.0 °F).\\n\\nH.8.1\\n\\nHOW TO MEASURE THE BODY TEMPERATURE?\\n\\nThe body’s temperature can be measured by a thermometer you place in the armpit, mouth, rectum, ear or on the forehead.\\n\\nH.8.1.1\\n\\nTYPES OF THERMOMETERS\\n\\nH.8.1.1.1\\n\\nMERCURY TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS\\n\\nIn a mercury thermometer, a glass tube is filled with mercury and a standard temperature scale is marked on the tube. A mercury thermometer can be easily identified by the presence of a silver bulb. Do not use mercury thermometers to measure the body temperature via the mouth or rectum.\\n\\nIf the bulb is red, blue, purple, green or any other colour, it is not a mercury thermometer, but contains another non-poisonous fluid. It works on the same principle as a mercury thermometer. These type of glass thermometers also can be used to measure the body temperature via the mouth or rectum.\\n\\nShake down the fluid in the glass thermometer before starting a new temperature measurement. Do this by holding the thermometer firmly and flicking the wrist until the fluid reads at or below the lowest number.\\n\\nWith changes in temperature, the fluid expands and contracts in a consistent fashion and the temperature can be read from the scale.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n219\\n\\nH.8.1.1.2\\n\\nELECTRONIC BODY TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS\\n\\nElectronic thermometers exist in different formats and types. These mostly work on battery power, some use sunlight as power source. They have a display where you can read the measurement (in Celsius or Fahrenheit corresponding to the device settings). Most electronic thermometers will beep when the measurement is complete and the body temperature can be read of the display.\\n\\nSpecial electronic thermometers exist to measure the temperature via the ear or via scanning the forehead.\\n\\nH.8.1.2 MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE\\n\\nH.8.1.2.1 MEASURING THE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE ARMPIT\\n\\n1.

They can usually be treated at home.\\n\\nInsect stings inside the throat are dangerous due to potential swelling and can be life- threatening.\\n\\nMites, ticks and leeches are found in marshes and jungles. They attach themselves firmly to the skin. Mites and ticks might carry typhus and may transmit it to the person. Ticks may also transmit the lyme disease.\\n\\nLeeches are mostly harmless, but suck blood from the victim.\\n\\nThe effects of stings from scorpions or bites of spiders vary according to the type of the insect. Note that not all insects are poisonous.\\n\\nJ.3.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nIf a person has been stung or bitten by an insect, you might observe:\\n\\n(cid:1) pain,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nredness or rash,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nitching,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsome animals stay sucked onto the skin.\\n\\nSome people experience an allergic reaction to the sting.

Slide a fingernail, the edge of a bankcard or whatever thin sturdy material you have at hand, under the sucker mouth (the smaller head of the leech) of the leech and flick it off right away. Do not squeeze the leech.\\n\\nThe person may also consider the leech to fill up and fall off by themselves.\\n\\nDo not put salt on the leech or burn it, as this will make the leech to vomit back into the wound before it falls of. Leech bites tend to bleed for a long time, apply a small bandage and change it regularly.\\n\\n4. Wash the sting or bite site and wipe away any venom.\\n\\n5. Do not suck or cut the venom out of the skin.\\n\\nDo not rub herbs on the bite.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nUse ice, if you have it, to cool the bite or sting.\\n\\nWrap the ice in a cloth or a towel so that it does not touch the skin directly.\\n\\nIf you do not have ice, use cold water.\\n\\nDo not cool for more than 20 minutes at a time.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n245\\n\\n7.

The outermost parts of eyes are covered by a smooth membrane (conjunctiva) and are kept moist by tears produced by the tear-glands.\\n\\nThe transparent portion of the eye is called cornea through which the light from the object passes and forms the image at the back of the eye. Behind the cornea is seen a coloured\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n248\\n\\ncircular diaphragm (iris) with a round opening (hole), the pupil. The latter varies in size with the amount of light passing through it.\\n\\nBehind the pupil is the lens of the eye which focuses rays of light on to the light sensitive part of the eye (retina).\\n\\nBoth eyes move simultaneously.\\n\\nK.1.2\\n\\nEAR\\n\\nThe ear consists of three parts:\\n\\n1. The outer ear is that part which can be seen projecting from the side of the skull, together with the canal which leads to the eardrum.\\n\\n2. The middle ear, situated inside the skull, receives and transmits sound waves concerned in hearing to the inner ear. It also communicates with the back of the nose and throat through the Eustachian tube, which opens during swallowing.\\n\\n3. The inner ear is embedded inside the skull and is concerned with the sense of balance in addition to the sense of hearing. The outer ear is separated from the middle ear by the eardrum.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n249\\n\\nK.1.3\\n\\nTONGUE\\n\\nThe tongue is the muscular organ which lies on the floor of the mouth; it assists in tasting, mastication and swallowing of food.\\n\\nIn an unconscious casualty, the tongue tends to obstruct by falling back in the throat and prevents breathing.\\n\\nK.1.4\\n\\nNOSE\\n\\nThe nose is organ of smell and also functions as part of the body\\'s respiratory system. Air enters into the body through the nose. As it passes over the specialized cells of the olfactory system, the brain recognizes and identifies smells. Hairs in the nose clean the air of foreign particles. As air moves through the nasal passages, it is warmed and humidified before it goes into the lungs.\\n\\nPeople may not taste anything without some help from the nose: the ability to smell and taste go together because odours from foods allow to taste more fully.\\n\\nK.1.5\\n\\nSKIN\\n\\nThe pain and touch receptors in the skin allow us to feel touch, pressure, heat, cold and pain. See also the chapter on ‘The skin’ for more detail.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n250\\n\\nK.2\\n\\nFOREIGN OBJECTS IN THE EYE, EAR, NOSE OR SKIN\\n\\nK.2.1\\n\\nFOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE\\n\\nWings of insects, dust, coal, metal particles from lathes and loose eye-lashes are common objects which get lodged under the eyelids. They cause pain and later redness if they are not removed at-once.\\n\\nSometimes iron particles and wood splinters get lodged in the cornea causing severe trouble.\\n\\nAll penetrating foreign bodies are a danger to the eye itself.\\n\\nK.2.1.1 WHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs or symptoms may be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of pain or discomfort in the eye.\\n\\n(cid:1) Redness and watery eyes.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of a blurred vision.\\n\\n(cid:1) Eyelids are screwed up in spasm.\\n\\nK.2.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\n1. Ask the casualty not to rub into the eye.\\n\\n2. Ask the casualty to sit. Pull the lower lid down to inspect.\\n\\n3. Rinse the eye immediately with plenty of water for 10-15 minutes, preferably from the nose outwards. Use clean water or water that has been boiled and cooled.\\n\\nBe careful:\\n\\n(cid:1) Water at room temperature is more comfortable than cold water.\\n\\n(cid:1) Very warm water might burn the eye.\\n\\nMake sure no liquid or rinsing water runs into the other eye.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n251\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf washing of eyes did not work, you may try to remove foreign object with a narrow moist swab or a twisted corner of a clean handkerchief.\\n\\nIf foreign body is not visible it may be under the upper eye lid. Ask the casualty to grasp his upper lashes and pull the upper eyelid over the lower lid. The lower lashes may brush the particle clear.\\n\\nIf this did not work, you may ask the casualty to blink under clean water. You can also use an eye cup to blink the eye in it.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIf something is sticking to or embedded in the eye, the eyeball or pupil, do not try to remove it.\\n\\n6. Cover the eye and transport the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility for further care.\\n\\n7. Do not put medication into the eye.\\n\\n8. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nK.2.2.1.1 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE ARE BURNS TO THE EYE?\\n\\nProvide first aid as described in the section on burns to the eye.\\n\\nK.2.2.1.2 WHAT DO I DO WHEN THERE ARE HARMFUL LIQUIDS SPILLED INTO THE EYE?\\n\\nProvide first aid as described in the section on chemical burns to the eye.\\n\\nK.2.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nEye injuries have to be managed always with great care. Always refer these victims to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n252\\n\\nK.3\\n\\nFOREIGN BODY IN THE EAR\\n\\nSometimes foreign objects become lodged in the ear. The object might even damage the drum.\\n\\nChildren often push objects into their ears. Cotton wool may get stuck in the ear while cleaning it. Insects may crawl or fly into the ear.\\n\\nK.3.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nFollowing signs or symptoms may be observed:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of pain or itching in the ear.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe person complains of worsened hearing.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere may be damage to the drum if:\\n\\no\\n\\nthe person hears a constant noise;\\n\\no\\n\\nthe person complains of ear pain;\\n\\no blood comes out of the ear, or\\n\\no\\n\\nthe person feels dizzy.\\n\\nK.3.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nNever try to get lodged objects out of the ear and always refer the person to a healthcare facility for further treatment.\\n\\nIn case of an insect, you may fill the ear with tepid clean water so the insect can float out. If it does not come out refer the person to a healthcare facility for further treatment.\\n\\nK.3.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nA casualty with an object lodged into the ear has always to be referred to a healthcare facility.\\n\\nAlso refer the casualty to a healthcare facility in case of an insect that flew or crawled into the ear and did not come out.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n253\\n\\nK.4\\n\\nFOREIGN BODY IN THE NOSE\\n\\nChildren sometimes push objects into their nose.

Do not put something into nose\\n\\n2. Do not fiddle with the foreign body. Make casualty breathe through the mouth.\\n\\n3. Transport the casualty to a healthcare facility for further treatment.\\n\\nK.4.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nA casualty with a foreign object in the nose is always to be transported or referred to the healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n254\\n\\nK.5\\n\\nFOREIGN BODY IN THE SKIN\\n\\nGlass, thorns, pieces of iron, wood or stone, needles, etc. may get stuck under the skin.\\n\\nUnless it is very easy to deal with (e.g. a wood splinter), do not fiddle with objects stuck under the skin.\\n\\nTreat the wound as described in section ‘Bleeding’, dress the wound and refer the casualty to a healthcare facility for further treatment.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n255\\n\\nK.6\\n\\nSWALLOWED FOREIGN OBJECTS\\n\\nSmall objects as coins and buttons may be swallowed by children. Most objects will follow the digestive track without issues. But they can also lead to choking.\\n\\nIn some cases the swallowed object may cause internal damage. This is specifically the case for swallowed batteries (containing corrosive and poisonous material), cigarette stubs, cosmetics, medication, poisonous plants, poisonous berries or fruits, or sharp objects (e.g. fish bones, partial dentures…). In these cases medical assistance is always required.\\n\\nK.6.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nExcept if the person is choking, you may not observe any signs or symptoms at first and it is the person himself who reports you that he swallowed something.\\n\\nSometimes the swallowed object may cause choking; this can result in a life threatening situation and has to be taken care of immediately (see section on ‘Choking’ for more detail).\\n\\nIn some cases the casualty may complain of pain in the throat, food pipe (oesophagus) or stomach. Also vomiting is possible. At a later stage blood may appear in the faeces.\\n\\nK.6.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nIn case the person is choking, treat as described in the section on ‘Choking’.\\n\\nIn case a small harmless object has been swallowed, the object will follow the normal track and be expelled via the faeces. In case of even small doubt, contact a healthcare facility.\\n\\nIn case of dangerous objects (batteries, cigarette stubs, cosmetics, medication, poisonous plants, poisonous berries or fruits …), sharp objects or when the person complains of pain, stomach ache, always refer the casualty to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nK.6.3\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nIn case a person swallowed dangerous objects (as batteries, cigarette stubs, cosmetics, medication, poisonous plants, poisonous berries or fruits …), sharp objects; or when the person complains of pain, stomach ache or blood loss in the faeces, he should be transported to the nearest healthcare facility.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n256\\n\\nL.\\n\\nURINARY EMERGENCY CHILDBIRTH\\n\\nSYSTEM,\\n\\nREPRODUCTIVE\\n\\nIn this chapter you will learn about:\\n\\n(cid:1) Urinary system. (cid:1) Reproductive system. (cid:1) Prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. (cid:1) Emergency childbirth.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\nSYSTEM AND\\n\\n257\\n\\nL.1\\n\\nURINARY SYSTEM\\n\\nThe body takes nutrients from food and converts them to energy. After the body has taken the food components that it needs, waste products are left behind in the bowel and in the blood.\\n\\nThe kidney and urinary systems help the body to eliminate liquid waste called urea, and to keep chemicals, such as potassium and sodium, and water in balance. Urea is produced when foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in the body. Urea is carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is removed along with water and other wastes in the form of urine.\\n\\nOther important functions of the kidneys include blood pressure regulation and the production of erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Kidneys also regulate the acid-base balance and conserve fluids.\\n\\nA pair of purplish-brown organs, the kidneys, are located below the ribs toward the middle of the back. The functions of the kidneys are to:\\n\\n(cid:1) Remove waste products and drugs from the body.\\n\\n(cid:1) Balance the body\\'s fluids.\\n\\n(cid:1) Release hormones to regulate blood pressure.\\n\\n(cid:1) Control production of red blood cells.\\n\\nThe kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a ball formed of small blood capillaries, called a glomerulus, and a small tube called a renal tubule. Urea, together with water and other waste substances, forms the urine as it passes through the nephrons and down the renal tubules of the kidney\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n258\\n\\nTwo narrow tubes (one on each side), called ureters, carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Muscles in the ureter walls continually tighten and relax forcing urine downward, away from the kidneys. If urine backs up, or is allowed to stand still, an infection can develop. About every 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine are emptied into the bladder from the ureters.\\n\\nThe bladder, a triangle-shaped, hollow organ, is located in the lower abdomen. It is held in place by ligaments that are attached to other organs and the pelvic bones. The bladder\\'s walls relax and expand to store urine, and contract and flatten to empty urine through the urethra. The typical healthy adult bladder can store up about 500-600 ml (ca. two cups) of urine for two to five hours.\\n\\nTwo sphincter muscles (circular muscles) help keep urine from leaking by closing tightly like a rubber band around the opening of the bladder. Nerves in the bladder alert a person when it is time to urinate, or empty the bladder.\\n\\nThe urethra allows urine to pass outside the body. The brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten, which squeezes urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincter muscles to relax to let urine exit the bladder through the urethra. When all the signals occur in the correct order, normal urination occurs.\\n\\nUrine in a healthy person is of a pale straw or transparent yellow colour.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n259\\n\\nL.2\\n\\nREPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\\n\\nL.2.1\\n\\nMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\\n\\nThe external reproductive organ of the male is the penis. The penis is made up of two parts, the shaft and the glans. The glans is the tip of the penis, while the shaft is the main part of the penis and contains the tube (urethra) that drains the bladder. All boys are born with a foreskin, or a covering over the tip of the penis. Some boys are circumcised, which means that this covering of skin is removed. Other boys are not circumcised and may have skin that covers the tip of the penis.\\n\\nThe scrotum is a bag of skin which holds and helps to protect the testicles. The testicles (or testes) are the male sex glands and are part of the male reproductive system. They are located in the scrotum. To make sperm the temperature of the testicles needs to be cooler than the inside of the body. This is why they are located in the scrotum outside body. The testes are also involved in producing a hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone during male development and maturation for developing muscles, deepening the voice, and growing body hair.\\n\\nA long tube, the epididymis, is located near each testicle. The epididymis is a collection of microscopic tubes in which the sperms are stored. The vas deferens is the tube which moves the sperms from the testicles out of the scrotal sac to the urethra and connects these together. Seminal vesicles, the sac-like glands, lie behind the bladder and release a fluid that forms part of semen.\\n\\nThe prostate gland is about the size of a walnut, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and urethra. The prostate gland secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal fluid, a fluid that carries sperms. During male climax (orgasm), the muscular glands of the prostate help to propel the prostate fluid, in addition to sperms that were made in the testicles, into the urethra.\\n\\nThe urethra is the tube that allows urine to flow outside the body. It is also the channel for semen to pass during ejaculation.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n260\\n\\nL.2.2\\n\\nFEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\\n\\nAlthough a woman’s external genitals are commonly referred to as the “vagina,” the vagina is actually one of several organs that comprise this section of a woman’s body.\\n\\nThe vagina is a muscular tube about three to four inches long that ends the birth canal. This is where a man’s penis enters the woman during sexual intercourse. The vaginal opening is visible from the outside but it is protected by the labia\\n\\nThe labia majora are two folds of skin that extend from the front of the vaginal opening to the back of it. The outer surfaces of the folds have darker-colored skin and thick hairs, while the inner folds are smoother. The labia majora join to form the cleft shape of the female genitals.\\n\\nThe clitoris is a crucial element for sexual arousal in most women. This small sexual organ at the junction of the labia minora appears outside the folds of skin like a small pink button. During sexual stimulation, the clitoris functions much like a man’s penis in that it becomes erect due to the signals from the brain. The clitoris is a very sensitive area when stimulated.\\n\\nBetween the labia majora are the labia minora, two folds of skin that also extend down from the clitoris and around the vaginal opening. These vary in size from woman to woman. They are joined together by a small fold of skin known as the fourchette.\\n\\nThe outer female genitals also include the urethra. Located between the vaginal opening and the frontal connection of the labia minora, the urethral opening is where a woman expels urine from her body.\\n\\nThe womb or uterus is located between the bladder and the rectum, in the pelvic area. The uterus is connected to the fallopian tubes, the cervix, and (via the cervix) the vagina.\\n\\nIn menstruating females, the ovaries release eggs that travel via the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If fertilized, the egg will bind to the wall of the uterus and the foetus will develop. The uterus nourishes and protects the foetus until birth.\\n\\nThe cervix of the uterus, also known as the cervix or uterine cervix, attaches the vagina to the uterus. It is approximately four centimetres long. The uterine cervix produces a mucus that aids in carrying sperm from the vagina to the uterus, where it can fertilize an egg if the woman is ovulating. When the woman isn\\'t ovulating, the cervical mucus thickens and serves as a barrier to keep sperm out of the uterus.\\n\\nDuring childbirth, the cervix thins out and eventually dilates (expands) to 10 centimetres to allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. Once the baby is born and the placenta is expelled, the cervix begins to thicken and close.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n261\\n\\nThe ovary is the ductless female reproductive gland in which the female reproductive cells are produced. Females have a pair of ovaries, held by a ligament beside the uterus on each side of the lower abdomen.\\n\\nDuring ovulation, a follicle (a small egg in the ovary) expels an egg under the stimulation of gonadotropic hormones. The rest of the follicle, or the corpus luteum, secretes the sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which regulate menstruation and control the development of the sex organs. The sex hormones and the gonadotropic hormones interact with each other to control the menstrual cycle.\\n\\nWhen an egg matures, it is released and passes into the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If the ovum is fertilized by the male reproductive cell, or sperm, conception happens and pregnancy begins.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n262\\n\\nL.3\\n\\nPREGNANCY\\n\\nThe signs of pregnancy vary from woman to woman. Usually the most obvious sign is the absence of menstruation (amenorrhea). However, some women may continue to have some bleeding even while pregnant. The following are the most common initial signs of pregnancy. However, each woman may experience the signs of pregnancy differently. These may include:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfatigue,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsore and swollen breasts,\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea or vomiting (also called morning sickness),\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfrequent urination,\\n\\n(cid:1) certain food cravings or aversions,\\n\\n(cid:1) bloating of the abdomen, and\\n\\n(cid:1) darkening of the skin around the breast nipples (also called the areola).\\n\\nThese early signs may not always indicate pregnancy, but may signal another process occurring within the body\\n\\nA pregnancy is divided into three phases, called trimesters. Each trimester has its own significant milestones. The first trimester is the most fragile period, during which all major organs and systems are formed. Most birth defects and miscarriages occur during the first trimester. During the second and third trimesters, the foetus is fully formed and grows and matures rapidly.\\n\\nAfter nine months of incredible growth and changes both in the mother and the foetus, labour (contractions) may finally start, signalling the pending birth of the baby. Some women may fear the prospect of delivering their child. Part of this fear may be attributed to the unknown, especially in first pregnancy.\\n\\nLabour is a series of continuous, progressive contractions of the uterus which help the cervix to open (dilate) and to thin (efface), allowing the foetus to move through the birth canal. Signs of labour vary from woman to woman, as each woman experiences labour differently.\\n\\nSome common signs of labour may include:\\n\\n(cid:1) A small amount of mucus, slightly mixed with blood, may be expelled from the\\n\\nvagina indicating a woman is in labour.\\n\\n(cid:1) Contractions (uterine muscle spasms) occurring at intervals of less than ten minutes are usually an indication that labour has begun. Contractions may become more frequent and severe as labour progresses.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLabour sometimes begins with amniotic fluid gushing or leaking from the vagina. Women who experience a rupture of the amniotic sac should go to the healthcare facility immediately. The majority of women go into labour within hours after the amniotic sac breaks. If labour still does not begin, it needs to be induced.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n263\\n\\nL.3.1\\n\\nSTAGES OF LABOUR AND GIVING BIRTH\\n\\nThere are three stages of labour:\\n\\n1. The first stage, when the contractions make the cervix gradually open up (dilate). This is usually the longest stage.\\n\\n2. The second stage of labour is when the cervix is fully open and birth is given. This is the part of labour where the baby moves through the vagina by the woman in labour pushing with the contractions.\\n\\n3. The third stage of labour is after the birth, when the womb contracts and causes the placenta to come out through the vagina.\\n\\nL.3.1.1\\n\\nTHE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR – DILATION\\n\\nThe cervix needs to open about ten cm for a baby to pass through. This is what\\'s called being \"fully dilated\". Contractions at the start of labour help to soften the cervix so that it gradually opens.\\n\\nThe woman in labour should attempt to get comfortable and relaxed, and if possible try to sleep. A warm bath or shower may help to relax.\\n\\nDuring the day, the woman in labour can keep upright and be gently active. This helps the baby move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate.\\n\\nOnce labour is established, the cervix reaches an opening of more than three centimetres; the time to full dilation is usually between 6 and 12 hours. It is often quicker in subsequent pregnancies. The woman in labour will be asked not to try to push until the cervix is fully open and the baby’s head can be seen. To help to overcome the urge to push, breathing out slowly and gently or, if the urge is too strong breathing in small puffs may help. Some women find this easier lying on their side, or on their knees and elbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby’s head on the cervix.\\n\\nL.3.1.2\\n\\nTHE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR\\n\\nThis is the \"pushing\" stage. It begins when the cervix is fully dilated and lasts until the birth of the baby. When the cervix is fully dilated the woman in labour will be asked to push when she feels the need to do so during contractions.\\n\\nThis stage of labour is hard work. This stage may take 1-2 hour.\\n\\nWHAT HAPPENS AT THE ACTUAL BIRTH?\\n\\nDuring the second stage, the baby’s head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When the head is almost ready to come out, the woman in labour will be asked to stop pushing and to do a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through the mouth. This is done so that the baby’s head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) time to stretch without tearing. The skin of the perineum usually stretches well, but it may tear. Afterwards, the cut or tear may be stitched up to help the healing process.\\n\\nOnce baby’s head is born, most of the hard work is over. With one more gentle push, the body is born quite quickly and easily. The baby may be born covered with a white, greasy substance known as vernix, which has acted as protection in the uterus.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n264\\n\\nL.3.1.3\\n\\nTHE THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR – THE PLACENTA\\n\\nAfter the baby is born, more contractions will push out the placenta.\\n\\nThe baby should be presented to the mother to be breastfed as soon after birth as possible. This helps with breastfeeding later on and it also helps the womb to contract. Babies start sucking immediately. However, this sometimes occurs just for a short period of time – they may just like to feel the nipple in their mouth.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n265\\n\\nL.4\\n\\nAFTERCARE OF THE MOTHER\\n\\nThe mother will be taken care of to recover from the labour as soon as possible. As the mother recovers after giving birth, following symptoms are not uncommon:\\n\\n(cid:1) Bloody vaginal discharge that changes to brown, then whitish over the next few\\n\\nweeks after delivery.\\n\\n(cid:1) Pain in perineal region.\\n\\n(cid:1) Painful contractions that may continue after delivery (as the uterus returns to its\\n\\noriginal size).\\n\\n(cid:1) Breast engorgement (as milk production begins).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFatigue, sorebreast and backache are common in the first few weeks.\\n\\n(cid:1) Piles (haemorrhoids) are common, but usually disappear after a few days.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for women to experience a \"baby blues\" period during the first days or weeks after delivery (most commonly seen occurring suddenly on the third or fourth day after delivery). These \"baby blues\" are characterized by the following symptoms, although each woman may experience symptoms differently:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeelings of disappointment,\\n\\n(cid:1) crying with no known reason,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nirritability,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nimpatience,\\n\\n(cid:1) anxiety, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrestlessness\\n\\nIt is common for these \"baby blues\" feelings to go away soon after onset and, in most cases, without treatment.\\n\\nThese symptoms may also be present in case of a postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is a more severe form of “baby blues”. Women with postpartum depression may have trouble coping with their daily tasks.\\n\\nThe following are the most common symptoms of postpartum depression; however, each woman experiences these symptoms differently:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsadness,\\n\\n(cid:1) anxiety,\\n\\n(cid:1) hopelessness,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfatigue or exhaustion,\\n\\n(cid:1) poor concentration,\\n\\n(cid:1) confusion,\\n\\n(cid:1) a fear of harming the new-born or herself,\\n\\n(cid:1) mood swings characterized by exaggerated highs and/or lows,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n266\\n\\n(cid:1) diminished libido (sex drive),\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeelings of guilt,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlow self-esteem,\\n\\n(cid:1) uncontrolled crying and with no known reason,\\n\\n(cid:1) over concern/over attentiveness for the new-born or a lack of interest for the new-\\n\\nborn,\\n\\n(cid:1) appetite changes,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsleep disturbances,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nresentment,\\n\\n(cid:1) memory loss, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeelings of isolation.\\n\\nWhile the exact cause for postpartum depression is unknown, it is likely that a number of different factors, such as the following, are involved:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe changing of roles (as a spouse and new parent),\\n\\n(cid:1) hormonal changes during and after delivery,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nstress,\\n\\n(cid:1) personal or family history of mental illness, particularly postpartum depression, and\\n\\n(cid:1) marital strife.\\n\\nIf you think someone may have postpartum depression, or if partner or family members are concerned about what the person does, it is important to refer the mother to her healthcare provider or healthcare facility as soon as possible. Do not let her wait until her next postpartum check-up.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n267\\n\\nL.5\\n\\nMEDICAL CONDITIONS AND PREGNANCY\\n\\nCertain medical conditions may complicate a pregnancy. However, with proper medical care, most women can enjoy a healthy pregnancy, despite their medical challenges. It is important that the pregnant woman contacts her healthcare provider early.\\n\\nL.5.1\\n\\nDIABETES\\n\\nDiabetes in pregnancy can have serious consequences for the mother and the growing foetus. The severity of problems often depends on the severity of the mother\\'s diabetic disease, especially if she has vascular (blood vessel) complications and poor blood glucose control.\\n\\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the condition in which the glucose level is elevated and other diabetic symptoms appear during pregnancy in a woman who has not previously been diagnosed with diabetes. In most cases of GDM, all diabetic symptoms disappear following delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life, especially if they were overweight before pregnancy. Unlike other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes is not caused by a lack of insulin, but by other hormones that block the insulin that is produced, a condition referred to as insulin resistance.\\n\\nL.5.2\\n\\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\\n\\nHigh blood pressure can occur in pregnancy in two forms. It may be a pre-existing condition, called chronic hypertension, or it can develop during pregnancy -- a condition known as gestational hypertension. It is also called toxemia or preeclampsia/eclampsia and occurs most often in young women with the first pregnancy. It is more common in twin pregnancies, and in women who had blood pressure problems in a previous pregnancy.\\n\\nHigh blood pressure can lead to placental complications and slowed foetal growth. If untreated, severe hypertension may cause dangerous seizures and even death in the mother and foetus.\\n\\nWomen who have high blood pressure before pregnancy often need to continue taking their antihypertensive medication. Such patients need to be managed by joint physician and gynaecologist care before conception and during pregnancy. Only the treating physician and the gynaecologist can give the correct advice on this.\\n\\nL.5.3\\n\\nINFECTIONS\\n\\nInfections during pregnancy can pose a threat to the foetus. Even a simple urinary tract infection or vaginal infection which is common during pregnancy, should be treated immediately. An infection that goes untreated can lead to preterm labour and rupture of the membranes surrounding the foetus.\\n\\nL.5.3.1\\n\\nFOOD POISONING (E.G. LISTERIOSIS)\\n\\nA pregnant woman should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods because of the risk of food poisoning. Food poisoning can dehydrate a mother and deprive the foetus of nourishment.\\n\\nL.5.3.2\\n\\nCHLAMYDIA\\n\\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can infect both men and women. It can cause serious, permanent damage to a woman\\'s reproductive system, making it difficult or impossible for her to get pregnant later on. Chlamydia infection is associated with tubal disease and tubal pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb) which can be fatal.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n268\\n\\nChlamydia--infections may be associated with premature labour and rupture of the membranes. New-borns can develop a chlamydia eye infection during childbirth, which may lead to blindness.\\n\\nThe only way to avoid STDs is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually active, the following things lower the chances of getting chlamydia:\\n\\n(cid:1) Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has\\n\\nbeen tested and has negative STD test results;\\n\\n(cid:1) Using condoms the right way every time having sex.\\n\\nL.5.3.3\\n\\nHEPATITIS\\n\\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting in liver cell damage and destruction. Several types of the hepatitis virus have been identified.\\n\\nThe most common type that occurs in pregnancy is hepatitis B (HBV). This type of hepatitis spreads mainly through contaminated blood and blood products, sexual contact, and contaminated needles and syringes. Although HBV resolves in many people, some will develop chronic HBV infection.\\n\\nHepatitis B virus can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Infected pregnant women can transmit the virus to the foetus during pregnancy and at delivery. The later in pregnancy a mother contracts the virus, the greater the chance for infection in her baby. A very safe and effective vaccine is available against HBV infection. Using safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent viral hepatitis B.\\n\\nThe only way to avoid sexual transmission is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually active, the following things lower the chances of getting HBV:\\n\\n(cid:1) Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has\\n\\nbeen tested and found negative for HBV;\\n\\n(cid:1) Using latex condoms the right way every time having sex.\\n\\nL.5.3.4\\n\\nHIV AND AIDS\\n\\nA woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has about one in four chance of infecting her foetus. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which kills or impairs cells of the immune system and progressively destroys the body\\'s ability to fight infections and certain cancers.\\n\\nHIV is spread most commonly by sexual contact with an infected partner. HIV may also be spread through contact with infected blood, especially by sharing needles, syringes, or drug use equipment with someone who is infected with the virus.\\n\\nSome people may develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after exposure to the HIV virus, although many people do not develop any symptoms at all when they first become infected. Persistent or severe symptoms may not surface for 10 years or more, after HIV first enters the body in adults, or within two years in children born with an HIV infection. The term AIDS applies to the most advanced stages of an HIV infection.\\n\\nUsing safe blood and safe needles and syringes will also prevent HIV/AIDS. The only way to avoid sexual transmission of STDs including HIV/AIDS is to not to have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If sexually active, the following things lower the chances of getting HIV:\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n269\\n\\n(cid:1) Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and found negative for HIV and other Sexually transmitted infections (STIs);\\n\\n(cid:1) Using latex condoms the right way every time having sex\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf a woman with HIV becomes pregnant she should be referred to concerned specialist and should be encouraged to get her viral loads and CD4 counts checked and should continue with medications.\\n\\nL.5.3.5\\n\\nGENITAL HERPES\\n\\nHerpes is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Genital herpes can be spread to the baby during delivery, if a woman has an active infection at that time.\\n\\nHerpes infections can cause blisters and ulcers on the mouth or face (oral herpes), or in the genital area (genital herpes). HSV is a life-long infection. Symptoms of HSV may include painful blisters or open sores in the genital area, which may be preceded by a tingling or burning sensation in the legs, buttocks, or genital region. The herpes sores usually disappear within a few weeks, but the virus remains in the body and the lesions may recur from time to time.\\n\\nIt is important that women avoid contracting herpes during pregnancy, because a first episode during pregnancy creates a greater risk of transmission to the new-born. Genital herpes can cause potentially fatal infections in babies if the mother has active genital herpes (shedding the virus) at the time of delivery. Fortunately, infection of an infant is rare among women with genital herpes infection. Protection from genital herpes includes abstaining from sex when symptoms are present, and /or using latex condoms the right way every time having sex.\\n\\nL.5.3.6\\n\\nCMV (CYTOMEGALOVIRUS)\\n\\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the herpesviruses. CMV is spread by close contact with a person who has the virus in his or her saliva, urine, or other body fluids.\\n\\nCMV can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her foetus during pregnancy. The virus in the mother’s blood crosses over the placenta and infects the fetus’ blood. Most babies with congenital (meaning present at birth) CMV infection never have health problems. But in some babies, congenital CMV infection causes health problems that may be apparent at birth or may develop later during infancy or childhood.\\n\\nA few simple steps can help to avoid exposure to saliva and urine that might contain CMV:\\n\\n(cid:1) Washing the hands often with soap and water for 40-60 seconds, especially after\\n\\n(cid:1) changing diapers,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeeding a young child,\\n\\n(cid:1) wiping a young child’s nose or drool, or\\n\\n(cid:1) handling children’s toys.\\n\\n(cid:1) Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils used by young children.\\n\\n(cid:1) Avoid contact with saliva when kissing a child.\\n\\n(cid:1) Clean toys, countertops, and other surfaces that come into contact with children’s\\n\\nurine or saliva.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n270\\n\\nL.5.3.7\\n\\nTOXOPLASMOSIS\\n\\nToxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite named Toxoplasma gondii. Although many people may have toxoplasma infection, very few have symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Babies who became infected before birth can be born with serious mental or physical problems. Toxoplasmosis often causes flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph glands, or muscle aches and pains that last for a few days to several weeks.\\n\\nThe following measures can help prevent toxoplasmosis infection:\\n\\n(cid:1) Wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil. Cats who may pass the parasite in their faeces, often use gardens. Avoid any contact with cat faeces. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after outdoor activities, especially before you eat or prepare any food.\\n\\n(cid:1) Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant handle raw meat for you. If this is not possible, wear clean gloves when you touch raw meat and wash any cutting boards, sinks, knives, and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward.\\n\\n(cid:1) Cook all meat thoroughly, that is, until it is no longer pink in the center or until the\\n\\njuices run clear. Do not sample meat before it is fully cooked.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n271\\n\\nL.6\\n\\nPREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STD)\\n\\nL.6.1\\n\\nSEXUAL TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS\\n\\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are passed from one person to another through unprotected sex.\\n\\nSome frequent STIs and STDs, in alphabetical order:\\n\\nL.6.1.1\\n\\nCHANCROID\\n\\nChancroid is a small bump in the genital area which is infected with a bacteria known as Haemophilus ducreyi. The bump is painful, soft and usually bursts and forms an ulcer within a day of its appearance. Along with this bump (or ulcer), small rubbery bumps (but different from the former) may also be felt in the crease between the belly and thigh.\\n\\nPeople infected with this bacteria spread it to others through sexual contact.\\n\\nL.6.1.2\\n\\nCHLAMYDIA\\n\\nChlamydia is common and is easily passed on during sex. Most people don\\'t experience any symptoms, so they are unaware they\\'re infected.\\n\\nIn women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods. It can also cause heavy periods.\\n\\nIn men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or watery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible to have a chlamydia infection in the rectum (bottom), throat or eyes.\\n\\nYou can get chlamydia through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or by contact with partner’s genitals, or sharing sex toys when they are not washed or covered with a new condom between each person who uses them. Sexual fluid from the penis or vagina can pass chlamydia from one person to another even if the penis does not enter the vagina, anus or mouth. This means you can get chlamydia from genital contact with someone who has the infection even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation. It isn’t clear if chlamydia could be passed on by transferring infected semen or vaginal fluid on the fingers, or by rubbing female genitals together. Chlamydia cannot be passed on through casual contact, including kissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery.\\n\\nL.6.1.3\\n\\nDONOVANOSIS\\n\\nDonovanosis is a sexually transmissible genital ulcer disease. The bacterium that causes it is Klebsiella granulomatis. It infects the skin around the genitals, groin or anal area and causes ulcers and destruction of the skin. After infection, one or more initially painless ulcers (sores) or lumps develop on the genitals, or around the anus or mouth.\\n\\nWithout treatment the ulcers will increase in size and can form a raised red fleshy lump that progressively destroys normal skin. Other bacteria can infect these sores, causing them to become painful and distressing with an unpleasant smell.\\n\\nDonovanosis is spread by sexual contact. Symptoms generally appear from 1-4 weeks after infection but occasionally may take as long as a year to develop. A very small proportion of people may be infected through direct, nonsexual contact (skin-to-skin contact).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n272\\n\\nL.6.1.4\\n\\nGENITAL WARTS – HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV)\\n\\nGenital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around the genital or anal area. They\\'re caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The warts are usually painless, but they may give some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding.\\n\\nGenital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. A person does not need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to- skin contact.\\n\\nL.6.1.5\\n\\nGENITAL HERPES\\n\\nGenital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the same virus that causes cold sores.\\n\\nSome people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. Small, painful blisters or sores usually develop, which may cause itching or tingling, or make it painful to urinate. After a person is infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the time. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, although they\\'re usually smaller and less painful.\\n\\nGenital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn\\'t have any symptoms, it\\'s possible for them to pass the infection to a sexual partner.\\n\\nL.6.1.6\\n\\nGONORRHOEA\\n\\nGonorrhoea is a STI easily passed on during sex caused by bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae or gonococcus. About 50% of women and 10% of men don\\'t experience any symptoms and are unaware that they are infected.\\n\\nIn women, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods.\\n\\nIn men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in the rectum, throat or eyes.\\n\\nGonorrhoea is easily passed between people through unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex or by sharing sex toys that haven\\'t been washed or covered with a new condom each time they are used. Gonorrhoea is not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towels, swimming pools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can\\'t survive outside the human body for long.\\n\\nL.6.1.7\\n\\nHEPATITIS B\\n\\nHepatitis B is a type of virus that can infect the liver.\\n\\nSymptoms can include feeling sick, lack of appetite, flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, general aches and pains, and headaches, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). However, many people don\\'t realise they have been infected with the virus because the symptoms may not develop immediately, or even at all. A mother can also pass on the hepatitis B infection to her new-born baby.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n273\\n\\nHepatitis B can be spread through blood and body fluids such as semen and vaginal fluids, so it can be caught during unprotected sex, including anal and oral sex and by sharing needles and syringes.\\n\\nL.6.1.8\\n\\nHIV\\n\\nThe HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it less able to fight infections and disease. There\\'s no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a long and otherwise healthy life.\\n\\nAIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections.\\n\\nMost people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop HIV, you may experience a flu-like illness with a fever, sore throat or rash. This is called a seroconversion illness.\\n\\nHIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected sex. It can also be transmitted by coming into contact with infected blood – for example, and sharing needles and syringes.\\n\\nL.6.1.9\\n\\nPUBIC LICE\\n\\nPubic lice (\"crabs\" (because they look similar to crabs.)) are easily passed to others through close genital contact. They\\'re usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body hair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes.\\n\\nIt may take several weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, and you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice are sometimes called crab lice because they look similar to crabs.\\n\\nPubic lice spread through close body contact with someone who has them. The lice crawl from hair to hair, but cannot fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally leave the body to move from one person to another. They are most commonly passed on during sexual contact. Condoms will not prevent them being passed to another person. It is also possible for pubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding.\\n\\nL.6.1.10\\n\\nSCABIES\\n\\nScabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels.\\n\\nIf a person develops scabies, he may experience an intense itching that\\'s worse at night. The itching can be in the genital area, but it also often occurs between the fingers, on wrists and ankles, under the arms, or on the body and breasts.\\n\\nThe infected person may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused with eczema. It\\'s usually very difficult to see the mites.\\n\\nScabies mites can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels.\\n\\nL.6.1.11\\n\\nSYPHILIS\\n\\nSyphilis is a bacterial infection (Treponema pallidum) that in the early stages causes a painless, but highly infectious, sore on the genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six weeks before disappearing.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n274\\n\\nSecondary symptoms such as a rash, flu-like illness or patchy hair loss may then develop. These may disappear within a few weeks, after which you\\'ll have a symptom-free phase.\\n\\nThe late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious conditions such as heart problems, paralysis and blindness.\\n\\nThe syphilis bacteria can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someone who is infected. It may also be possible to catch syphilis by sharing needles for drug use with somebody who is infected. Pregnant women can pass the infection to their unborn baby. Syphilis also cannot be spread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutlery or bathroom as an infected person, as the bacteria cannot survive for long outside the human body.\\n\\nL.6.1.12\\n\\nTRICHOMONIASIS\\n\\nTrichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be easily passed on through sex and most people don\\'t know that they\\'re infected.\\n\\nIn women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an unpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine.\\n\\nIn men, trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms. You may experience pain or burning after passing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin.\\n\\nThe parasite is usually spread by having unprotected sex (without using a condom), although it can also be spread by sharing sex toys. You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who is sexually active can catch it and pass it on. Trichomoniasis cannot be passed on through oral or anal sex, kissing, hugging, sharing cups, plates or cutlery, toilet seats or towels.\\n\\nL.6.2\\n\\nWHEN TO REFER TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY?\\n\\nAny person who is at risk and doubts he might be infected, if had unprotected sex with a potentially infected person or has been exposed to multiple sex partners should always be referred to the nearest sexual health clinic or healthcare facility for a check-up as soon as possible.\\n\\nSex workers should always be advised to have frequent regular check-ups.\\n\\nL.6.3\\n\\nREDUCING THE RISK OF STDS/STIS\\n\\nEffective strategies for reducing STD risk include:\\n\\nL.6.3.1\\n\\nABSTINENCE SEX\\n\\nThe most reliable way to avoid infection is to not to have sex, especially anal and oral sex.\\n\\nL.6.3.2\\n\\nMUTUAL MONOGAMY\\n\\nMutual monogamy means to agree to be sexually active with only one person, who has agreed to be sexually active only with the same person.\\n\\nBeing in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STDs.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n275\\n\\nL.6.3.3\\n\\nCONDOMS\\n\\nCorrect and consistent use of the male latex condom is highly effective in reducing STD transmission. Use a condom every time you have sex.\\n\\nL.6.3.4\\n\\nREDUCED NUMBER OF SEX PARTNERS\\n\\nReducing the number of sex partners decreases the risk of STDs. It is important to get tested for STDs regularly.\\n\\nL.6.3.5\\n\\nVACCINATIONS\\n\\nVaccines are safe, effective, and recommended ways to prevent hepatitis B and HPV. HPV vaccines for males and females can protect against some of the most common types of HPV. The person can discuss this option with his healthcare provider.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n276\\n\\nL.7\\n\\nEMERGENCY CHILDBIRTH\\n\\nPregnant women should always visit a health centre or another healthcare facility for pregnancy follow-up from the moment the woman notices she is pregnant.\\n\\nExpectant mothers usually reach the health centre on time, but there may be some situations where this is not possible, for instance in the last stages of pregnancy when an expectant mother can go into labour at any time.\\n\\nAs a first aider you might be required to assist with the delivery of the baby during emergency childbirth.\\n\\nL.7.1\\n\\nWHAT DO I SEE AND ENQUIRE?\\n\\nThe following signs indicate that labour has started and the baby is about to be born:\\n\\n(cid:1) painful contractions occurring at increasingly shorter intervals,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe waters break,\\n\\n(cid:1) blood mixed sticky discharge,\\n\\n(cid:1) abdominal discomfort,\\n\\n(cid:1) urge to push, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlocalised back pain.\\n\\nL.7.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nALL PREGNANT WOMEN MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO OPT FOR\\n\\nAN INSTITUTIONAL DELIVERY.\\n\\nL.7.2.1\\n\\nWHEN TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO A HEALTHCARE FACILITY DURING PREGNANCY?\\n\\nIf at any time the mother feels the loss of foetal movement, feels sick or has concerns about her or the baby\\'s health, she should visit the healthcare facility and consult a doctor.\\n\\nIf any of the following symptoms show, the mother should go to the healthcare facility without any delay:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfever and weakness or unable to get out of bed,\\n\\n(cid:1) pain in the belly and/or bad smelling discharge from the vagina,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsudden bleeding or increasing loss of blood,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfits,\\n\\n(cid:1) difficulty in breathing, fast breathing or chest pain,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nirregular heartbeat, palpitations,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nterrible headache and blurry vision,\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea and vomiting,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfaintness or dizziness,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nswelling of the feet,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n277\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlabour that starts before 34 weeks of gestation,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlabour that lasts longer than 12 hours.\\n\\nIf there is a healthcare facility in the area, it is best to arrange immediate transportation to take the woman there. If not, send for a trained birth attendant or health worker to help.\\n\\nL.7.2.2\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO IF THE WOMAN IS IN LABOUR OR IF THE WATERS HAVE BROKEN?\\n\\nIf there is a healthcare facility in the area, it is best to arrange immediate transportation to take the woman there. If not, send for a trained birth attendant or health worker to help.\\n\\nL.7.2.3\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN I HAVE TO ASSIST IN AN EMERGENCY BIRTH?\\n\\n1. Encourage the expectant mother\\'s companions and relatives to be involved.\\n\\n2. Praise and encourage the mother.\\n\\n3. Protect and respect her privacy and the local or religious customs.\\n\\n4. Wash your hands before assisting. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n5. Provide a reassuring touch to reduce anxiety\\n\\n6. Encourage the woman to move around and find the most comfortable position.\\n\\n7. Let her urinate often. A full bladder delays the process of labour and increases the chances of tearing and bleeding.\\n\\n8. Permit sips of water to moisten the lips during labour.\\n\\n9. Encourage her to breathe out calmly and to relax with each breath.\\n\\n10. Seek immediate help if you notice the following complications:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe baby is coming out with the hips or feet first, instead of his head.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere are no contractions six hours after the waters break.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe contractions continue for more than 12 hours.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe woman is bleeding and/or she has fever.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n278\\n\\nL.7.2.4\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO DURING THE PUSHING STAGE?\\n\\n1. Support the woman in a comfortable position.\\n\\nAn upright position is the best, but a lying position is the least challenging to assist with delivery.\\n\\nYou can put a pillow under the right hip.\\n\\n2. Wash your hands with water and soap. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n3. Put on (disposable) gloves or use a clean plastic bag to avoid contact with the bodily fluids.\\n\\n4. Naturally, at this stage, the mother feels the urge to push.\\n\\nIf the pushing is not working, tell her to change position and to empty her bladder.\\n\\nTell the mother not to push when the baby\\'s head is out.\\n\\n5. Watch the baby come out while supporting the baby\\'s head and shoulders.\\n\\nDo not pull the baby out.\\n\\nDo not push on the woman\\'s belly during labour or after the delivery.\\n\\nL.7.2.5\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN THE BABY IS BORN?\\n\\n1.\\n\\nImmediately after birth, place the baby on the mother\\'s bare chest or abdomen so that they can have skin-to-skin contact.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n279\\n\\n2. To sterilise the cutting equipment, boil it for ten minutes or run it through a flame a few times and let it cool down.\\n\\n3. Cut the baby\\'s cord:\\n\\na. Create two knots/ties:\\n\\n1. The first knot/tie is two cm (about three fingers) away from the baby\\'s abdomen.\\n\\n2. The second knot/tie is four cm (about five fingers) away from the first knot/tie.\\n\\nb. Cut between the two knots/ties with a clean razor blade, scissors or a knife.\\n\\nc. Create another knot/tie on the side of the baby\\'s abdomen if the cord\\n\\ncontinues to bleed after it has been cut.\\n\\nd. Keep the cord dry and clean.\\n\\n4. Wipe the baby\\'s skin clean and dry and ensure that the baby is kept warm and close to the mother.\\n\\n5. The baby can be dressed or wrapped.\\n\\n6. The placenta or afterbirth will come out naturally on its own. When it is out, put it somewhere safe until it can be disposed of properly.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n280\\n\\nDo not pull on the umbilical cord to remove the placenta and afterbirth. If the cord rips, it may cause infection or severe bleeding.\\n\\n7. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\n8. Encourage the mother to breastfeed the newborn. Although there is no breast milk at that moment, the baby\\'s sucking will stimulate the production of milk.\\n\\nImmediate breast-feeding also helps the placenta to come out and prevents bleeding of the mother after delivery.\\n\\n9. Encourage the mother to move around as soon as she feels able and ready to do so.\\n\\n10. Do not leave the mother unattended during the first 24 hours after giving birth.\\n\\n11. The mother should go to a healthcare facility for further check-up and management.\\n\\nL.7.2.6\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN THE BABY IS NOT BREATHING OR NOT BREATHING NORMALLY?\\n\\n1. Tell the mother that the baby is having problems breathing and that you will help.\\n\\n2. Move the baby on to a clean, dry and warm surface.\\n\\n3. Keep the baby wrapped and warm.\\n\\n4. Start CPR for the baby.\\n\\n5. Stop resuscitating after 20 minutes if the baby is not breathing or gasping for air and explain to the mother what has happened and offer her support.\\n\\nL.7.2.7\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO WHEN THE MOTHER IS BLEEDING HEAVILY AFTER GIVING BIRTH?\\n\\n1. Call for help and arrange urgent transport to the nearest healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\n2. Massage the mother\\'s belly firmly below the navel. This might slow down the bleeding.\\n\\n3. Ask the mother to urinate if possible. This might slow down the bleeding.\\n\\nL.7.2.8\\n\\nWHAT DO I DO AFTER ASSISTING THE EMERGENCY BIRTH?\\n\\nAfter birth, mother and baby should always be transported to a healthcare facility for further checkup and follow up.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n281\\n\\nM.\\n\\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID\\n\\nIn this chapter you will learn about:\\n\\n(cid:1) What is psychological first aid?\\n\\n(cid:1) Traumatic crisis.\\n\\n(cid:1) How do I provide (psychological) first aid?\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n282\\n\\nM.1\\n\\nDEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID\\n\\nIt is a process of facilitating resilience within an individual to enable to bounce back from the impact of crisis and help him to deal with the event/crisis by respecting the independence, dignity and coping mechanism.\\n\\nIn the past first aid was mainly focussed on giving physical first aid to an injured or suddenly sick person by someone who happens to be present when the accident happened or the illness occurred.\\n\\nTraumatic events and sickness may stress people. They might feel overwhelmed, worried, confused or feel uncertainness. Some people might show little or no signs, others might present with a more severe reaction.\\n\\nThe SPHERE (2011) and IASC (2007) define psychological first aid (PFA) as a humane, supportive response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support. It includes:\\n\\n(cid:1) providing practical care and support, which does not intrude;\\n\\n(cid:1) assessing needs and concerns;\\n\\n(cid:1) helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nlistening to people, but not pressuring them to talk;\\n\\n(cid:1) comforting people and helping them to feel calm;\\n\\n(cid:1) helping people connect to information, services and social supports, and\\n\\n(cid:1) protecting people from further harm.\\n\\nPhysical and psychological first aid go hand in hand and should be delivered simultaneously.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n283\\n\\nM.2\\n\\nTRAUMATIC CRISIS\\n\\nA traumatic crisis is caused by a sudden, unexpected and intense incident.\\n\\nThe event, as in following examples\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\ntraffic accident, a fire, …;\\n\\n(cid:1) natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, …);\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nserious illness;\\n\\n(cid:1) death of a close one;\\n\\n(cid:1) violence, robbery, attack, rape …;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfinancial difficulties;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrelational difficulties;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsuicide (attempt);\\n\\n(cid:1) etc,\\n\\nproduces a significant emotional shock that temporarily overwhelms the individual.\\n\\nThe traumatic crisis will almost always follow a certain pattern. One may say that the traumatic crisis can be divided into four phases:\\n\\n1. (Psychological) Shock phase.\\n\\n2. Reaction phase.\\n\\n3. Processing phase.\\n\\n4. Reorientation phase.\\n\\nM.2.1\\n\\n(PSYCHOLOGICAL) SHOCK PHASE\\n\\nThe shock phase follows immediately after the event which triggered the crisis. During the shock phase, the person is not yet able to comprehend the event that caused the crisis and may even deny it. While some people in shock become completely paralysed, others behave in a mechanical and cold way. Some people in shock may become strongly agitated; they may scream or cry furiously. People may also alternate between paralysis and restlessness states. The reactions of people in shock, such as apparent lack of feelings, may confuse the people close to them and even cause embarrassment or resentment.\\n\\nThe shock phase may include:\\n\\n(cid:1) denial,\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n284\\n\\n(cid:1) emotional shutdown,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfeeling surreal and like an outsider, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nshouting, crying and panic.\\n\\nReactions during the (psychological) shock phase may seem scary and strange.\\n\\nM.2.2\\n\\nREACTION PHASE\\n\\nThe immediate danger is over. The person will slowly face the tragic incident and try to understand what has happened. At the beginning of the reaction phase, people might experience strange and unexpected sensations; for example, they may feel that the person they have lost is still around or they may hear their voice somewhere.\\n\\nThe feelings of people in the reaction phase are often very similar to each other and they are often expressed in the same form: \"I think I’m going crazy\", \"I can’t take it any more\", \"will I ever make it through?\", \"life feels like a rollercoaster\", or \"will this pain last forever?\", for example.\\n\\nThe reaction phase may include:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nfear and anxiety,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nself-accusations and the need to find someone to blame,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsleeplessness and loss of appetite, and\\n\\n(cid:1) nausea or other physical symptoms.\\n\\nDuring the reaction phase of a crisis, people often feel the need to be heard. They may feel the need to discuss the matter over and over again. This may feel very heavy and consuming to the people close to the individual.\\n\\nM.2.3\\n\\nPROCESSING PHASE\\n\\nIn the processing phase, the person begins to understand what has happened. The matter is no longer denied; instead, the person understands that the incident and all its changes and losses are really true. The person is ready to face all the different aspects of the incident and the new personal situation. He is aware of the changes caused by the crisis and often begins to analyse his own identity and personal convictions and beliefs. He begins to think beyond the event, but will not yet have strength to plan for the future. Nevertheless, the person is preparing to face the future. He also regains the capability to better concentrate on everyday’s life.\\n\\nThe processing phase may include:\\n\\n(cid:1) problems with memory and concentration,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nirritability, and\\n\\n(cid:1) withdrawal from social relationships.\\n\\nM.2.4\\n\\nREORIENTATION PHASE\\n\\nThe crisis is over. The person is able to live with what has happened, and it is no longer constantly on his mind. Every once in a while, the pain will resurface but there is also joy in life; the person will be able to look to the future and regain confidence in life.\\n\\nNevertheless, the course of a crisis is not always straightforward; for example, things reminding of the incident can bring back heavy thoughts, anxiety and other symptoms.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n285\\n\\nM.3\\n\\nHOW DO I PROVIDE (PSYCHOLOGICAL) FIRST AID?\\n\\nLife-saving first aid is a top priority. It is important to start with limiting the physical injuries. You must first and foremost give life-saving first aid where necessary, in order to make sure that the injured persons get to the hospital alive. Doing the best you can to limit the injuries as much as possible also has a very soothing effect on the injured ones, and on all others present: ‘There is someone who helps’.\\n\\nM.3.1\\n\\nBEHAVE CALMLY\\n\\nBehaving calmly has a very soothing effect on the casualties and the psychically affected persons. Calmness can be just as contagious as uneasiness.\\n\\nBehaving calmly is:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSpeaking quietly in a normal pitch.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFocus the right amount of time on the person you are there to help, instead of running from one thing to the other.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nShowing clearly that you have time to take care of the affected person.\\n\\n(cid:1) Avoiding mentioning that it seems to take too long for the ambulance or other\\n\\nhelping teams to arrive.\\n\\nM.3.2\\n\\nLISTEN TO THE AFFECTED PERSON\\n\\nThe affected person must be given the opportunity to tell what he has experienced. This is called “Venting”.\\n\\nYou must accept what he tells you, and you must not comment on it; only ask questions which make him enlarge upon the subject.\\n\\nPerhaps his account sounds quite unbelievable, but to him that is what he has experienced or thinks he has experienced. By telling about the experiences he gets a chance to recognize for himself that quite incredible things, which he thinks he has experienced and which make him frightened, are not true. This way he can get free of these fantasies.\\n\\nVenting experiences also has the result that he gets them sorted out and gets them placed in the proper succession in his memory. It makes it easier to endure having experiences emerging as a tangled series of frightening pictures which he cannot control at all.\\n\\nYou should:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTry to find a quiet place to talk, and minimize outside distractions.\\n\\n(cid:1) Respect privacy and keep the person’s story confidential, if this is appropriate.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n286\\n\\n(cid:1) Behave appropriately by considering the person’s culture, age and gender.\\n\\n(cid:1) Respect the person’s right to make his own decisions.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nStay near the person but keep an appropriate distance depending on their age, gender and culture.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nLet them know you are listening; for example, nod your head or say “ hmmmm….”\\n\\n(cid:1) Be patient and stay calm.\\n\\n(cid:1) Be honest and trustworthy.\\n\\n(cid:1) Provide only factual correct information, if you have it. Be honest about what you know and don’t know. Say “I don’t know, but I will try to find out about that for you.” if you can’t answer the question.\\n\\n(cid:1) Give information in a way the person can understand and keep it.\\n\\n(cid:1) Acknowledge how he is feeling.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIf he tells you about any losses or important events, such as loss of the home or death of a loved one, reply with “I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is very sad for you.”\\n\\n(cid:1) Acknowledge the person’s strengths and how he has helped himself.\\n\\n(cid:1) Allow for silence.\\n\\n(cid:1) Make it clear to people that even if they refuse help now, they can still access help\\n\\nin the future.\\n\\nM.3.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATION WHEN GIVING HELP\\n\\nConsider following basic topics when providing help or when you ask bystanders to give help:\\n\\n(cid:1) Get his personal belongings gathered.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFind out where he is going.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFind out how he got there.\\n\\n(cid:1) Make sure that there is someone who can take care of the affected one when he\\n\\narrives at the destination.\\n\\nM.3.4\\n\\nPHYSICAL CONTACT\\n\\nIt helps incredibly and creates an immediate sense of security, if you take the hand of the affected person or put an arm around his shoulder while you listen to him. If he cries - which in itself is very good for him - you can allow him to put his head on your shoulder.\\n\\nPhysical contact is so important because the affected person unconsciously will try to protect himself from the violent psychic trauma by reacting like a child. For this reason contact with a \"grown-up\" helper may help him to feel more secure.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n287\\n\\nM.3.5\\n\\nALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE “HAVE A GOOD CRY”\\n\\nCrying is a strong outburst of feeling and a means of getting rid of extremely oppressive feelings. It is therefore very important to cry when the urge to do so arises.\\n\\nBut crying is also very visible and audible expression of being affected by strong feelings and for some reason this is considered \"embarrassing\" in many culture. It is necessary that we set aside our culture constraints; when you are giving psychological first aid the affected person should be allowed to give way to his feelings. Tell him you understand this.\\n\\nM.3.6\\n\\nPROTECT AGAINST INQUISITIVE ONLOOKERS\\n\\nThe affected person will be embarrassed showing his feelings, and he will, altogether, feel sorry to let other people see him in this particular situation.\\n\\nA person may react on the onlookers in different ways. He may try to hide himself in an \"ostrich like\" manner by holding his hands in front of his face, but he may just as well react very aggressively and abuse them.\\n\\nYour help must consist in getting the affected one away from the onlookers, or make them leave the area.\\n\\nM.3.7\\n\\nDO NOT LET THE AFFECTED PERSON BE ALONE\\n\\nEven if the affected person does not like to have people around him, it is not a good idea to leave him alone with his psychic crisis. His feelings will seem much more oppressive when he is alone with them.\\n\\nYou have to make sure that someone else can stay with him, if you cannot continue to provide help. It is important that the person who stays with him knows what has happened, and what the situation is. It will also be of great advantage, if the helper who takes over, knows the basics of psychological first aid and provides the best humane support.\\n\\nM.3.8\\n\\nPROVIDING PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID TO ALL\\n\\nThis means giving immediate emotional support to those who are physically injured, as well as to those who are not physically injured but might be psychologically impacted.\\n\\nAlso, look after the confused, the lost, and those who are separated from families. Care for those who are left behind. Help them to be re-united with their relatives.\\n\\nRecovering from a psychological injury can take longer than recovering from a wound. The person may need your continuing support in the weeks ahead\\n\\nWhen there are mass casualties follow the instructions of the medical team in charge.\\n\\nM.3.9\\n\\nDON’T FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF\\n\\nHelping responsibly also means taking care of your own health and wellbeing.\\n\\nAs a helper, you may be affected by what you experience in a crisis situation, or you or your family may be directly affected by the event. It is important to pay extra attention to your own wellbeing and be sure that you are physically and emotionally able to help others. Take care of yourself so that you can care best for others.\\n\\nIf working in a team, be aware of the wellbeing of your fellow helpers as well.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n288\\n\\nN.\\n\\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT\\n\\nIn this chapter you will learn about:\\n\\n(cid:1) Emergencies at school.\\n\\n(cid:1) Emergencies at work.\\n\\n(cid:1) Road and traffic accidents.\\n\\n(cid:1) Emergencies in rural areas.\\n\\n(cid:1) Disasters and multiple casualty accidents.\\n\\n(cid:1) Triage.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n289\\n\\nN.1\\n\\nEMERGENCIES AT SCHOOL\\n\\nChildren are highly vulnerable to injuries and accidents. Usually these are only minor bruises and grazes, but sometimes the child may incur a severe accident resulting in fracture, bleeding, suffocation, fainting, burns, drowning or electric shock (etc.).\\n\\nAlso, a school staff member may suffer a heart attack or a respiratory disorder with which first aiders have to cope.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances the first aider should be able to rise to the occasion, instead of getting nervous. There are several simple procedures anyone can learn and, if correctly and immediately applied, can make the difference between life and death.\\n\\nChildren are liable to the same type of emergencies and injuries as adults in similar circumstances. Details on how to handle emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and includes the following:\\n\\n1. Assess the situation.\\n\\n2. Safety first.\\n\\n3. Alert and seek help.\\n\\n4. Provide first-aid.\\n\\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed.\\n\\n6. Hygiene.\\n\\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There is no substitute for proper training!\\n\\nThe school management should ensure that:\\n\\n(cid:1) a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available,\\n\\n(cid:1) a trained first aider(s) is(are) available in the school or is on call, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nin each class at least one child (preferably more) is trained in first aid.\\n\\nHaving trained first aiders available is a great asset to the school at the time of emergency.\\n\\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John Ambulance organize first aid trainings for teachers, staff and students. Make sure each school has a SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for any disaster including violence by fellow students and others.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n290\\n\\nN.2\\n\\nEMERGENCIES AT WORK\\n\\nA common injury in workshop and factories is a worker being stuck in or pinned down under the machinery. This can result in twisted limbs, lacerations, severe bleeding and fractures, and may lead to shock.\\n\\nIn some cases it is not possible to extricate or release the victim easily. In all cases, the machinery should be stopped immediately, the power of the machine cut off and a person who is familiar with handling the machine or a senior foreman should be called to the scene.\\n\\nMost modern machines have automatic releasing devices. Eventually, machine parts may have to be dismantled to get access and release the casualty.\\n\\nThe first aider must assess the situation, ensure the safety for himself and casualty, control any bleeding, provide the necessary first aid, prevent shock and reassure the casualty. He continuously needs to observe the casualty’s condition. It is best to cover any injured or burned parts when possible. Provide CPR when needed, and arrange for immediate medical aid on site or transport to a healthcare facility or hospital.\\n\\nDetails on how to handle this and other emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and includes the following:\\n\\n1. Assess the situation.\\n\\n2. Safety first.\\n\\n3. Alert and seek help.\\n\\n4. Provide first-aid.\\n\\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed.\\n\\n6. Hygiene.\\n\\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There is no substitute for proper training!\\n\\nThe workshop or factory management should ensure that:\\n\\n(cid:1) a well-equipped first aid room or station with the necessary materials is available;\\n\\n(cid:1) a trained first aider(s) is (are) available in the workshop or factory, or is on call;\\n\\n(cid:1) preferably some workers (or all) are trained in first aid; and\\n\\n(cid:1) all the workers should be sensitized about possible hazards and help available.\\n\\nHaving trained first aiders available at the workplace is a great asset to the workshop or factory at the time of emergency.\\n\\nIn case of accidents in deep mines such as coal mines rescue work is also very important besides first aid and is to be arranged urgently. Only trained specialised rescuers with special safety devices can provide this. All mines have to arrange the continuous availability of these teams and the required rescue materials.\\n\\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John Ambulance organize first aid trainings for workers, miners and laypeople.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n291\\n\\nN.3\\n\\nROAD AND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS\\n\\nOn many occasions the victims of road side accidents remain lying on the spot without medical aid or any help of the public until the arrival of police, which in many cases may take time.\\n\\nThe members of the public do not basically have an indifferent attitude in such situation, but they have a fear that instead of receiving credit for helping the injured or by transporting him to a medical facility or hospital, there might be harassment by the police who might look to them with suspicion. They may also feel that they will have to bear the expenditure of the transportation.\\n\\nThis thinking is not correct. A person who is lying helpless can be relieved from sufferings if someone provides the appropriate first aid and transport him to the nearest medical facility. Even a little knowledge of first aid of trained laypeople can save lives.\\n\\nTo overcome this difficulty and to create public awareness of the moral duty to help, the government, the court and the police have been issuing instructions via the press, posters and radio- and TV-spots that members of public are to be given a positive response in their noble task helping and transporting the injured at the earliest to the healthcare facility or hospital for further medical aid. Instructions have also been given to police staff to ensure that such persons who bring an injured to the hospital for medical aid are not be detained. It should suffice for the emergency centres in hospitals to ask only following questions to the person who brings the injured to the hospital:\\n\\n1. Where have you brought this casualty from?\\n\\n2. Do you know anything about the cause of the injury of the casualty?\\n\\n3. May I have your particulars?\\n\\nIt is likely that the person would answer the first question, but may not be able to answer the second one. He might hesitate to answer to the third question, in which case it should not be insisted upon. The escorts should, under no circumstances be detained in the hospital for interrogation. On the other hand he should be treated with courtesy.\\n\\nHowever, rendering aid to the injured is the moral and civil duty of each and every one of us.\\n\\nDetails on how to handle these emergency cases are described in the various chapters of this training programme. The procedure of attending an emergency always remains the same and includes the following:\\n\\n1. Assess the situation.\\n\\n2. Safety first.\\n\\n3. Alert and seek help.\\n\\n4. Provide first-aid.\\n\\n5. Transport or refer to a healthcare facility, if needed.\\n\\n6. Hygiene.\\n\\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There is no substitute for proper training!\\n\\nHaving trained first aiders available is always a great asset to the public at the time of emergency.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n292\\n\\nIn air crash or railway accidents, comprehensive skilled medical facilities are made available by the concerned authorities. The instructions issued by these teams are to be followed.\\n\\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John Ambulance organize first aid trainings for commercial drivers, driving schools and laypeople.\\n\\nEmergency telephone numbers (for example, police, fire, ambulance etc.) should be repeatedly displayed at important places and in media.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n293\\n\\nN.4\\n\\nEMERGENCIES IN RURAL AREA\\n\\nMedical facilities are often inadequately available, especially in the remote villages. It is also difficult to transport the injured or sick persons due to difficult roads or the non-availability of proper transport services. A charpai could be used in the village in place of stretcher.\\n\\nIn rural areas following specific types of injuries are frequent:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFall from a tree or fall of a branch onto a victim (people have the habit to sit or sleep under the shade of trees in the summer).\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFall from walls or roofs. The roofs of houses in villages have usually no parapet walls and children may fall from the roof.\\n\\n(cid:1) Collapsing of mud walls or roofs of houses onto people.\\n\\n(cid:1) Caving in of mud while digging and getting buried under the mud.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFall from horseback, or getting kick of a horse or donkey or other animals.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFall from a jhulah (suspension bridge) when the rope snaps.\\n\\n(cid:1) Drowning in the village pond, well or in canal water.\\n\\n(cid:1) Railway track accident (when walking on or crossing a railway line or when sitting\\n\\nor hanging on a wagon).\\n\\n(cid:1) Being crushed under a bus, car, tractor or other vehicles.\\n\\n(cid:1) Boat disasters.\\n\\n(cid:1) Bites of snakes, scorpions, leeches, dogs (rabies!), monkeys, tigers, jackal or camels.\\n\\n(cid:1) Heat stroke, heat exhaustion and hyperthermia.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFrostbite in hilly areas.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nFood poisoning.\\n\\n(cid:1) Poisoning by DDT or other insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers.\\n\\n(cid:1) Cut from sharp agricultural equipment.

There is no substitute for proper training!\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n294\\n\\nHaving trained first aiders available is a great asset to the community at the time of emergency.\\n\\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John Ambulance organize first aid trainings for communities and laypeople.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n295\\n\\nN.5\\n\\nDISASTERS AND MULTIPLE CASUALTY ACCIDENTS\\n\\nIndia is such a vast country that some part is affected by flood, drought, cold, heat-wave, fire, earthquake, vehicle or train accidents … at any given time. These incidents can cause huge losses from collapsed buildings, damaged crops to large number of human casualties. Sometimes disasters strike suddenly.\\n\\nRendering of first aid to the victims affected by a disaster is a very important relief activity and is a part of the first aid training programmes. Mass casualty management stresses the importance of the role of first responders and first aiders in disaster relief and counts on their preparedness to respond to emergency situations.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been renewed realizations that the people who become victim of injury or sudden illness need not only immediate attention but also proper medical care. Thus, it is imperative that first aid training and practice should keep pace with modem medical advancements.\\n\\nUnfortunately, many human lives are lost or disturbed by disasters and accidents. These stressful life events should be supported by appropriate and timely psychological aid. It is very important that someone is helping in making necessary arrangements, giving practical advice, listening to the grievances, assuaging the feelings and providing physical comfort by being with them. It is also important to educate victims about stress reactions and where to refer to for further help. These tasks do not require a psychologist, but trained first aiders can assist supporting these victims.\\n\\nFor smooth working at a disaster or mass casualty accident site the first aiders need to:\\n\\n(cid:1) Have the appropriate knowledge and training\\n\\nin\\n\\nfirst aid and disaster\\n\\nmanagement.\\n\\n(cid:1) Have the capability to think practically and be able to improvise, if required.\\n\\n(cid:1) Obtain the full particulars nature of the accident or disaster and the affected site.\\n\\n(cid:1) Coordinate with the appropriate governmental authorities.\\n\\n(cid:1) Coordinate with other local agencies, other institutions or organizations.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nList the resources (transport capacity, available medical personnel, available first responders and first aiders, stand by medical equipment, available medication supplies, available equipment and disaster relief materials, etc.) he has at his disposal and have an estimate how fast he can mobilize these resources.\\n\\n(cid:1) Obtain permission to act from the superior officer on site.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSurvey the site, the situation and the security risks.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSurvey the casualties.\\n\\n(cid:1) Allot the priorities for treatment and transport of the casualties.\\n\\n(cid:1) Provide the necessary assistance.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTreat and transport the casualties to the assigned medical facilities.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSubmit a daily report to the concerned authorities and to his organization.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nSubmit on completion of the mission a detailed final report to the concerned local authorities as well as his St. John Ambulance Headquarters or to his Red Cross Society along with his observations and suggestions.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n296\\n\\nTraining and exercising helps the first aider to act swiftly, calmly and in the correct way. There is no substitute for proper training!\\n\\nHaving trained first aiders available is a great asset at the time of disasters.\\n\\nIt is again underlined that there is no substitute for proper training. The Red Cross and St John Ambulance organize first aid and disaster management trainings.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n297\\n\\nN.6\\n\\nEMERGENCY TRIAGE\\n\\nTriage is derived from the French trier, meaning ‘to sort or sieve’. In medicine, this is the process of sorting patients in order of priority for treatment and evacuation. Triage may take many different forms, and operates at a number of different levels. However, it aims to give the right patient the right care at the right time in the right place.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances, this may also mean ‘doing the most for the most’. Originally developed for use in military conflicts, triage is equally applicable to civilian disasters and in day-to-day emergency settings. Accurate triage allows correct identification of those patients who need the most urgent intervention, as well as quickly and safely identifying those who can wait longer for treatment. The latter are the majority at a typical major incident. Triage may also be used to identify patients who are so severely injured that they will not survive, or whose treatment will tie up resources that would be best used for other patients.\\n\\nTriage is dynamic ‒ as the patient’s condition progresses, so his/her need for intervention alters, and the triage category will change.\\n\\nThe casualties are classified in different categories:\\n\\nCategory (cid:2)\\n\\nUrgency\\n\\nInjuries\\n\\nCondition\\n\\nSurvival rate\\n\\nTransport\\n\\nRED (U1 or I) Extremely urgent.\\n\\nLife-threatening injuries.\\n\\nCardiac arrest. Hypoxia. Shock. Life- threatening bleeding. Low if no urgent medical treatment. Better if medical treatment available. Immediate transport when stabilized with team medical escort in medically equipped ambulance\\n\\nYELLOW (U2 or II) Fast needed. Constant follow up of breathing and circulation required. Severe. Not immediately life-threatening.\\n\\ntreatment\\n\\nRelatively stable condition. Bleeding under control. Breathing. Good when timely medical treatment is provided.\\n\\nUrgent transport (after RED) when stabilized under paramedic observation equipped ambulance\\n\\nin\\n\\nGREEN (U3 or III) Non treatment.\\n\\nurgent\\n\\nLocalised injuries. Non-life- threatening. Walking wounded.\\n\\nHigh.\\n\\nNon-urgent (after transport RED, YELLOW) by ambulance or available any (taxi, transport car).\\n\\nBLACK\\n\\nDeceased.\\n\\nFatal injuries.\\n\\nNo respiration. No pulse. CPR unsuccessful.\\n\\nNone.\\n\\nPost transport morgue\\n\\nmortem to\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n298\\n\\nPlease note:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThere is a fifth category: the non-wounded (sometimes tagged ‘BLUE’). They are victims of the incident but seem not to be injured.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInside each category, i.e. the categories RED and YELLOW, all casualties of the same are again ‘categorized by urgency’. For example, casualties with difficult breathing in category YELLOW will be attended first before patients in the same category with a better condition.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTriaging is a snapshot of the moment the victim has been evaluated. Victims of one category can move in between categories. For example, a patient in category GREEN was walking around, but due to an internal bleeding his condition deteriorates and he becomes a category YELLOW, even RED, depending on his ‘new’ condition.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIn a mass casualty incident assigning the triage category is done very quickly. The category ‘BLACK’ (deceased) may be assigned to all casualties that are not breathing without even a CPR attempt (as incident is so massive and there are too many casualties that have to be attended with very limited resources). When more help arrives, and if the situation allows, these victims might be re-evaluated.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIn most mass casualty disasters, a zone for the RED (U1), YELLOW (U2) and GREEN (U3), the deceased (BLACK) and non-wounded (BLUE) will be assigned.\\n\\n(cid:1) Always make sure somebody is also observing the casualties in the GREEN zone and the non-wounded (BLUE) as some signs and symptoms of an injury may only show over time.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n299\\n\\n(cid:1) Always follow the directives of the medical team on place or of the leader in charge. He assigns people to perform the triage, to assist in the different triage zones, or who will be responsible for managing the transport capacity, etc.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n300\\n\\nO.\\n\\nFIRST AID TECHNIQUES: DRESSINGS, BANDAGES AND TRANSPORT TECHNIQUES\\n\\nIn this chapter you will learn about:\\n\\n(cid:1) Dressings.\\n\\n(cid:1) Bandages.\\n\\n(cid:1) Fast evacuation techniques (single rescuer).\\n\\n(cid:1) Transport techniques.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n301\\n\\nO.1\\n\\nDRESSINGS\\n\\nA dressing is a protective covering applied to a wound to:\\n\\n(cid:1) prevent infection,\\n\\n(cid:1) absorb discharge,\\n\\n(cid:1) control bleeding,\\n\\n(cid:1) avoid further injury, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nreduce pain.\\n\\nAn efficient dressing should be sterile (germ free) and have a good degree of porosity to allow for oozing and sweating.\\n\\nO.1.1\\n\\nTYPES OF DRESSINGS\\n\\nO.1.1.1\\n\\nADHESIVE DRESSINGS (BAND AID)\\n\\nThese sterile dressings consist of a pad of absorbent gauze of cellulose held in place by a layer of adhesive material. Sterile adhesive dressings are supplied in paper or plastic covers.\\n\\nThe surrounding skin must be dry before application and all the edges of the dressing pressed firmly down.\\n\\nO.1.1.2\\n\\nNON ADHESIVE DRESSING\\n\\nO.1.1.2.1\\n\\nREADY-MADE STERILE DRESSING\\n\\nThe dressing consists of layers of gauze covered by a pad of cotton wool and with an attached roller bandage to hold it in position. The dressing is enclosed and sealed in protective covering (which is only broken while applying) and is supplied in various sizes.\\n\\nO.1.1.2.2 GAUZE DRESSING\\n\\nGauze in layers is commonly used as a dressing for large wounds, as it is very absorbent, soft and pliable. It is liable to adhere to the wound; however, it may assist the clotting of blood. The dressing should be covered by one or more layers of cotton wool.\\n\\nO.1.1.3\\n\\nIMPROVISED DRESSING\\n\\nThese can be formed from any clean soft absorbent material such as a clean handkerchief, a piece of linen, a clean paper, or cellulose tissue. They should be covered and retained in position.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n302\\n\\nO.1.2\\n\\nHOW DO I APPLY A DRESSING?\\n\\nYou should cover a wound with a dressing as this helps to prevent infections.\\n\\nHygiene always comes first! Always wash your hands.\\n\\nWash your hands before and after taking care of the patient. Use soap and water to wash your hands. If no soap is available, you can use ash to wash your hands. Alcohol-based sanitizers can also be used, if available.\\n\\nPut on gloves if available. You can also use a clean plastic bag. Try not to come in contact with the person’s blood and other body fluids.\\n\\nThe dressing must be covered with adequate pads of cotton wool, extending well beyond them and retained in position by a bandage or strapping.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n303\\n\\nO.2\\n\\nBANDAGES\\n\\nA bandage is a fairly long strip of material such as gauze used to protect, immobilize, compress, or support a wound or injured body part.\\n\\nThere are a number of different first aid uses for bandages: they can be used to secure dressings, control bleeding, support and immobilize limbs, reduce pain, and control swelling in an injured part. These are made from flannel, calico and elastic net or special paper.\\n\\nIf you have no bandage available, you can improvise one from an everyday item; for example, you can fold a square of fabric, such as a headscarf, diagonally to make a triangular bandage, and a roller bandage if further folded. A belt, tie or some other materials can also be used as an improvised bandage.\\n\\nBandages should be applied firm enough to keep dressing and splints in position, but not as tight as to cause injury to the part or to impede the circulation of the blood. A bluish tinge of the finger or nails may be a danger sign indicating that the bandage is too tight. Loss of sensation is another sign; such bandages should be loosened or removed quickly.\\n\\nO.2.1\\n\\nTYPES OF BANDAGES\\n\\nThere are several types of bandages.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTriangular bandages (also referred to as “master bandage”) can be used as large dressings, or as slings, to secure dressings or to immobilize limbs.\\n\\n(cid:1) Roller and crepe bandages secure dressings and support injured\\n\\nlimbs.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nTubular bandages hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints.\\n\\nO.2.1.1\\n\\nTRIANGULAR BANDAGES\\n\\nA triangular bandage is made by cutting a piece of calico about 100 cm square from corner to corner giving two triangular bandages.\\n\\nIt has three borders. The longest is called the “base” and the other two the “sides”. There are three corners. The one opposite the base is called the “point” and the other two are called the “ends”. While applying a triangular bandage, the point always moves first.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n304\\n\\nAlso a “reef knot” is always tied to enable easy loosening, tightening or opening.\\n\\nO.2.1.2\\n\\nSLINGS\\n\\nSlings are used to:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsupport injured arms;\\n\\n(cid:1) prevent pull by upper limb to injuries of chest, shoulder and neck, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nsecure splints when applied.\\n\\nO.2.1.2.1 ARM SLING (LARGE ARM SLING, TRIANGULAR ARM SLING WITH UNDERARM HORIZONTAL)\\n\\nThe large arm sling is used in cases of injuries of arm, wrist and hands after application of dressing and/or splints, plaster casts and bandaging.\\n\\nTo apply an arm sling:\\n\\n1. Face the casualty, hold the bandage point firmly, put one end of the spread triangular bandage over the uninjured shoulder with point towards the elbow of the injured side.\\n\\n2. Pass the end around the neck and bring it over the injured side shoulder. The other end will now be hanging down over the chest.\\n\\n3. Place the forearm horizontally across the chest at 90° and bring the hanging end\\n\\nup. The forearm is now covered by the bandage.\\n\\n4. Tie the two ends in such a way that the forearm is horizontal or slightly tilted upward and the knot (reef knot) is placed in the pit above the collar-bone.\\n\\n5. Hold the point with one hand & the bandage at little finger with the other and stretch it tight to check for any object like Bangle, watch or metal ring etc. beneath the bandage.\\n\\n6. Tuck the part of the sling point which is loose at the elbow behind the elbow and bring the fold to the front and pin it up to the front of the bandage.\\n\\n7. Place the free base of the bandage in such a way that its margin is just at the base of the nail of the little finger. The nails of all the fingers should be exposed.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n305\\n\\n8.\\n\\nInspect the nails to find if there is any bluish colour. A bluish colour shows that there is a dangerous tightening of splints or plasters and therefore, free flow of blood is not possible.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIf the casualty is not wearing a coat, place a soft pad under the neck portion of the sling to prevent rubbing of the skin in that place.\\n\\nO.2.1.2.2 COLLAR ‘N’ CUFF SLING\\n\\nThis sling is only used to support the wrist.\\n\\nTo apply a collar-N-cuff sling:\\n\\n1. The elbow is bent; the forearm is placed across the chest in such a way that the fingers point the opposite shoulder. In this position the sling is applied.\\n\\n2. A clove hitch is made with narrow bandage. Two loops are made and are laid on top of the other, the front loop is laid behind the back loop without turning.\\n\\n3. A clove-hitch is passed round the wrist and the ends tied in the neck pit above the collarbone on the injured side.\\n\\nO.2.1.2.3\\n\\nTRIANGULAR SLING (WITH UNDERARM UPWARDS)\\n\\nA triangular sling is used to support the fracture of the collar bone, arms or injured shoulder, and also crushed or badly burned palms. It helps to keep the hand raised high up giving relief from pain due to the fracture.\\n\\nTo apply a triangular sling:\\n\\n1. Place the forearm across the chest with the fingers pointing towards the opposite shoulder, touching the collar bone and the palm over the breast-bone.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n306\\n\\n2. Place an open bandage over the arm/chest, with one end over the hand and the point beyond the elbow.\\n\\n3. Tuck the base of the bandage comfortably under the forearm and hand.\\n\\n4. Fold the lower end also around the elbow and take it up and across the back of the shoulder (uninjured side) and tie it into the hollow above the collar bone by using a reef knot.\\n\\n5. Tuck the fold so formed backwards over the lower half of the arm and fix it with a safety pin.\\n\\nO.2.1.3\\n\\nBANDAGES\\n\\nA triangular bandage can be used as:\\n\\n(cid:1) a whole cloth (spread out fully) or called “open bandage”\\n\\n(cid:1) one fold”\\n\\n(cid:1) a broad bandage (two folds):\\n\\nBring the point to the center of the base and then fold again in the same direction to create a broad bandage. Fold the bandage once again to make it a narrow bandage.\\n\\nA broad bandage can also be used as a roller bandage of approximately 6 inches (about 14 cm) size.\\n\\n(cid:1) a narrow bandage (three or more folds):\\n\\nWhen a smaller size bandage is needed fold the original so as to bring the ends together. The size is now reduced by half the original.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n307\\n\\nA narrow bandage can also be used as a roller bandage.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.1\\n\\nSCALP BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\n1. Fold a narrow hem of the base of an open bandage and place it on the forehead just above the level of the eye-brows.\\n\\n2. Take the two ends backwards, after placing the body of the bandage over the head, the point hanging near the nape of the neck.\\n\\n3. Cross the two ends and take them forward above the ears to meet on the forehead, where they are tied.\\n\\n4. Press on the head of the patient, draw the point firmly downwards and pin it to the bandage after taking it upwards.\\n\\n5. A suitable sized ring pad, also made from a triangular bandage, can be placed beneath the head bandage at an appropriate place to put pressure around any depressed fracture of skull.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.2\\n\\nFOREHEAD, EYE, CHEEK/JAW FRACTURE BANDAGE OR BANDAGE FOR ANY PART WHICH IS ROUND IN SHAPE\\n\\nUse two triangular bandages folded as a broad or narrow bandage.\\n\\n1. Use narrow or broad bandage depending upon the size of the wound.\\n\\n2. Apply the center of the bandage over the injury and wind the bandage round the part.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n308\\n\\n3. Tie in a suitable place.\\n\\n4. May apply a narrow bandage to keep the first bandage in place.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.3\\n\\nFRONT OR BACK OF THE CHEST BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\n1. Place the center of the open bandage over the dressing point over the sound shoulder.\\n\\n2. Carry the ends of the bandage around the body and tie it in such a way that one end is longer than the other.\\n\\n3. Draw the “point” over shoulder and tie to the longer end.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf back of chest has the wound-reverse all the steps.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.4\\n\\nSHOULDER BANDAGE\\n\\nUse a broad bandage.\\n\\n1. Stand facing the injured side.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n309\\n\\n2. Place the center of the open bandage on the shoulder with the point over the side of the neck reaching the ear.\\n\\n3. Carry the ends crossed, after hemming the base inward around the middle of the arm and tie the knot on the outer side so that the lower border of the bandage is in fixed position.\\n\\n4. Thereafter apply also a sling to rest the arm of the injured side in.\\n\\n5. Turn down the point of the bandage over the sling knot draw it tight and pin it.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.5\\n\\nELBOW BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\n1. Bend the elbow to a right angle if it is feasible to do so.\\n\\n2. Folding a suitable hem of the base of a triangular bandage and apply it as follows:\\n\\na. Lay the point on the back of the upper arm and the middle of the base on\\n\\nthe back of the forearm.\\n\\nb. Cross the ends in front of the elbow, then round the arm and tie the ends\\n\\nabove the elbow.\\n\\nc. Turn the point down and pin it low down.\\n\\nWhen the elbow cannot be bent use a roller bandage with figure of eight technique.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.6 HAND BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n310\\n\\n1. Place the open bandage in such a way that the injury is uppermost. The point should be towards the fingers and the base across the wrist.\\n\\n2. Now bring the point over to the wrist.\\n\\n3. Make a narrow inward hem as usual, pass the ends around the wrist, cross over and tie it up over the point.\\n\\n4. Turn the point over the knot and pin it.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.7 HIP AND GROIN BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular and a narrow bandage.\\n\\n1. Kneel facing the hip and tie a narrow bandage around the waist with the knot on the uninjured side.\\n\\n2. Take a second open bandage and pass its point under the knot bring it over the knot and pin it.\\n\\n3. Make a suitably broad hem of the base, bring the ends round the thigh, cross and tie a knot on the outer part, so as to hold the lower hemmed border in position.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.8 KNEE BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open traingular bandage.\\n\\n1. Bend the knee to a right angle.\\n\\n2. With a narrow inward hem, place the open bandage in front of the knee with the point upon the thigh.\\n\\n3. Cross the ends, take them upwards on the back of the thigh, bring them to the front of the thigh and tie up.\\n\\n4. Bring the point down over the knot and the knee and pin it up.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n311\\n\\nIn case the knee is not to be bend, a figure of eight bandage using a narrow or a broad bandage is applied.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.9\\n\\nFOOT BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\n1. Place the foot in the centre of an open bandage with the point beyond the toes.\\n\\n2. Draw the point over the foot on to the leg.\\n\\n3. Cover the heel with the ends.\\n\\n4. Cross the ends around the ankle at the back.\\n\\n5. Bring the ends forward and tie them in front of the ankle.\\n\\n6. Bring the point down and pin it up.\\n\\nO.2.1.3.10 STUMP BANDAGE\\n\\nUse an open triangular bandage.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n312\\n\\n1. Place the base of a bandage well up on the inside of the stump, the point hanging downwards.\\n\\n2. Draw up the point over the stump and cross the ends in front, over the point.\\n\\n3. Carry the ends behind the stump, cross them and bring them forward, tying off in front.\\n\\n4. Draw the point firmly downwards over the knot and secure with a safety pin.\\n\\nO.2.2\\n\\nROLLER BANDAGES\\n\\nRoller bandages are used in hospitals and first aid posts. They are made out of cotton material with loose mesh. They are of various lengths and widths.\\n\\nUsed for Finger Hand Arm Leg Trunk\\n\\nWidth in cm 2 5 5 or 6 7.5 or 9 10 or 15\\n\\nWidth in inch 1 2 2 or 2.5 3 or 3.5 4 to 6 inch\\n\\nRoller bandages are also meant to keep dressings in position. The rolled part is called the “drum” or “head”, the unrolled portion the “tail”.\\n\\nRoller bandages should be applied firmly and evenly.\\n\\nTo apply a roller bandage, always:\\n\\n1. Face the patient.\\n\\n2. Always keep the “tail” of the bandage towards the patient and the “head or drum” towards you.\\n\\n3. When bandaging left limb, hold the head of the bandage in the right hand and vice versa.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n313\\n\\n4. Apply the outer surface of the bandage over the pad and wind it around the injury twice so that it is firm.\\n\\n5. Bandage from below upwards over the limb. Also make it a rule to apply bandage from the inner side to the outer side.\\n\\n6. Check that the bandage is neither too loose nor too tight.\\n\\n7. Roll bandage so that each layer covers two thirds of the earlier layer.\\n\\n8. Fix the bandage by pinning it up or using adhesive plaster. The usual practice of tearing the final end into two long tails and tying them up is quite satisfactory and practical.\\n\\nThere are four methods of applying roller bandages as follows:\\n\\nO.2.2.1\\n\\nSINGLE OR SIMPLE SPIRAL\\n\\nPICTURE CHANGE\\n\\nThe roller bandage is applied in a simple spiral. This is used on fingers or other uniform surfaces. The bandage is just carried around in spirals.\\n\\nO.2.2.2\\n\\nREVERSE SPIRAL\\n\\nThis is a modified spiral in which the roll is reversed downwards on itself at each round. This technique should be used where the thickness of the part varies such as a leg, forearm, etc.\\n\\nO.2.2.3\\n\\nFIGURE OF EIGHT\\n\\nIn this, the bandage is applied obliquely alternative up and down, so that the loops appear like the figure of eight. It is used for joints like the elbow, knee etc.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n314\\n\\nO.2.2.4\\n\\nSPICA\\n\\nThis is a modified figure-of-eight, and is usefull for bandaging the hip, shoulder, groin or tumb.\\n\\nO.2.3\\n\\nCREPE BANDAGES\\n\\nThese are roller bandages made of elastic cotton weaving material. These are used to support sprains or other soft tissue injuries where there is no wound. These serve the purpose of supporting the injured joints and also help in reducing the pain and swelling.\\n\\nThese can be applied directly on the skin. The techniques of application are same as a roller bandage. These should not be applied too tightly.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n315\\n\\nO.3\\n\\nFAST EVACUATION TECHNIQUES (SINGLE RESCUER)\\n\\nIn case the casualty is in a dangerous situation following are possible one-rescuer evacuation techniques to move an unconscious casualty over a very short distance to get him into safety.\\n\\nOnly attempt to rescue a casualty if the scene is safe for yourself!\\n\\nO.3.1\\n\\nSHOULDER PULL\\n\\n1. Grasp the casualty by the clothing under the shoulders.\\n\\n2. Keep your arms on both sides of the head and support the head.\\n\\n3. Try to pull the casualty in a straight line, if possible.\\n\\nO.3.2\\n\\nANKLE PULL\\n\\nThis method is the fastest method to move a casualty over a short smooth distance. However it is not a preferred method as the head is unsupported and may bounce over the surface bumps.\\n\\n1. Grasp the casualty by both ankles and pant cuffs.\\n\\n2. Pull the casualty. Use your legs to apply force to pull, not your back. Keep your back as straight as possible.\\n\\n3. Pull the casualty in a straight line if possible.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf the casualty is lying on a sheet, a plastic or a blanket, pull the same as per convenience.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n316\\n\\nO.4\\n\\nTRANSPORT TECHNIQUES\\n\\nAfter appropriate first aid has been given, the patient may need to be transported.\\n\\nKeep following guidelines in mind when transporting a casualty:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe position assumed by the casualty or in which he has been placed, should not be disturbed unnecessarily.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThroughout the transport a careful watch must be kept on:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe general condition of the casualty (breathing, consciousness);\\n\\n(cid:1) any dressing that may have been applied;\\n\\n(cid:1) any recurrence of haemorrhage, and\\n\\n(cid:1) any signs of changes or worsening of the casualty’s condition.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nThe transport must be safe, steady and speedy.\\n\\nThe injured or sick person may be moved to a shelter, medical facility or hospital by:\\n\\n(cid:1) a single helper;\\n\\n(cid:1) hand seats and the ’kitchen-chair’ carry technique by multiple helpers;\\n\\n(cid:1) blanket lift by multiple helpers;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nstretcher by multiple helpers;\\n\\n(cid:1) wheeled transport (ambulance, car, …); or\\n\\n(cid:1) air and sea travel (with specially trained staff).\\n\\nThe method to be used (and it may be necessary to use more than one technique) may depend on:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe nature and severity of the injury;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe number of helpers and facilities available;\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe distance to the shelter, medical facility or hospital; and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe nature of route to be covered.\\n\\nO.4.1\\n\\nSINGLE HELPER TRANSPORT.\\n\\nIf you are the only person available, following techniques can be used to transport a casualty:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe cradle technique,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe human crutch technique,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe pick-a-back technique, or\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nthe fire man\\'s lift and carry technique\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n317\\n\\nO.4.1.1 CRADLE TECHNIQUE\\n\\nThis technique is only to be used in the case of light casualty or children.\\n\\nLift the casualty by passing one of your arms well beneath his two knees and the other round his back.\\n\\nO.4.1.2\\n\\nHUMAN CRUTCH TECHNIQUE\\n\\nStanding at his injured side except where there is injury to an upper limb, assist the casualty by putting your arm round his waist, grasping the clothing at him and placing his arm round your neck, holding his hand with your free hand.\\n\\nIf his upper limbs are injured and his other hand is free, the casualty may gain additional help from a staff or walking stick.\\n\\nIf both legs are injured, another first aider might hold the other side in a similar way (see human crutch technique with two helpers).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n318\\n\\nO.4.1.3\\n\\nPICK-A-BACK TECHNIQUE\\n\\nIf the casualty is conscious and able to hold, he may be carried in the ordinary “pick-a-back\" fashion.\\n\\nO.4.1.4\\n\\nFIREMAN\\'S LIFT AND CARRY TECHNIQUE\\n\\nTo be used only when the casualty is not heavy for the bearer.\\n\\n1. Help the casualty to rise to upright position.\\n\\n2. Grasp his right wrist with your left hand.\\n\\n3. Bend down with your head under his extended right arm so that your right shoulder is level with the lower part of his abdomen and place your right arm between or around his legs.\\n\\n4. Taking his weight on your right shoulder come to the erect position.\\n\\n5. Pull the casualty across both shoulder and transfer his right wrist to your right hand, so leaving your left hand free. This allows the helper also to move up or down a ladder whilst carrying the casualty.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n319\\n\\nO.4.2 MULTIPLE HELPER TRANSPORT.\\n\\nWhen multiple helpers are available, following transport techniques can be used.\\n\\nO.4.2.1\\n\\nHUMAN CRUTCH TECHNIQUE\\n\\nStanding at both sides of the casualty, both helpers assist the casualty by putting their arm round his waist, grasping the clothing at him and placing each of his arm on their side around their neck, holding his hand with their free hand.\\n\\nO.4.2.2\\n\\nHAND SEAT TECHNIQUES\\n\\nAlso known as the four-handed seat technique. This seat is used when the casualty can assist the bearer by using one or both arms.\\n\\n1. Two bearers face each other behind the casualty and grasp their left wrists with their right hands and each other\\'s right wrist their left hands.\\n\\n2. The casually is instructed to place one arm around the neck of each bearer so that he may raise himself to sit on their hands and steady himself during transport.\\n\\n3. The bearers rise together and step off, the bearer on the right hand side of the casually with the right foot and the left hand bearer with the left foot.\\n\\n4. The bearers walk with the cross-over step and not by side paces.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n320\\n\\nO.4.2.3\\n\\nTHE TWO-HANDED SEAT TECHNIQUE\\n\\nThis seat is mostly used to carry a casualty who is unable to assist the bearers by using his arms.\\n\\n1. Two bearers face each other and stoop down (not kneel) one on each side of the casualty.\\n\\n2. Each bearer passes his forearm nearest the casualty\\'s head under his back just below the shoulders and if possible takes hold of his clothing.\\n\\n3. They slightly raise the casualty\\'s back and then pass their other forearms under the middle of his thighs and grasp their hands, the bearer on the left of the casualty with his palm upwards and holding a folded handkerchief to prevent hurting by the finger nails; the bearer on the right of the casualty with his palm downwards, as shown in (“hook grip”).\\n\\n4. The bearers rise together and stoop off, the right- hand bearer with the right foot and the left-hand bearer with the left foot.\\n\\n5. The bearers walk with the cross-over step and not by side paces.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n321\\n\\nO.4.2.4\\n\\nTHE FORE AND AFT METHOD TECHNIQUE\\n\\nThis method of carrying should be used only when space does not permit a hand seat.\\n\\n1. One bearer stands between the casualty\\'s legs, facing the feet with hands down and grasps the casualty under his knees.\\n\\n2. The other bearer takes a position behind the casualty and after raising his trunk passes his hands under the casualty\\'s armpits and grasps his own wrists on the casualty\\'s chest.\\n\\n3. The casualty is then lifted.\\n\\n4. The bearers walk in step.\\n\\n5. A chair can be used also to carry the casualty when negotiating a narrow passage or moving up/down the stairs (see kitchen-chair carry technique).\\n\\nO.4.2.5\\n\\nTHE KITCHEN-CHAIR CARRY TECHNIQUE\\n\\nThe bearers walk in step by carrying the patient in a chair. Use this method when the casualty is light weight and the distance is small.\\n\\nThis technique allows to climb up or down steps or stairs whilst carrying the casualty.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n322\\n\\nO.4.2.6\\n\\nBLANKET LIFT TECHNIQUE\\n\\n1. Place the casualty on to a blanket:\\n\\na. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the casualty, and rolled\\n\\nlengthwise for half its width.\\n\\nb. Place the roller portion of the blanket or rug close to the casualty\\'s back and\\n\\ngently rolls him over the roll until he is lying on his opposite side.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf the casualty is suspected to have suffered a head, neck or spine injury or a fracture, two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs. The other 4-6 bearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being taken against movement at the site of the fracture. The bearers at the head and at the lower limbs conform to the rolling of the casualty throughout.\\n\\n3. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or rug gently lowering the casualty on his back so that he lies on the centre of the open blanket or rug.\\n\\n4. During lifting by a blanket, the edges are rolled up close to the casualty\\'s sides and lifted by two or three persons on either side.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n323\\n\\nO.4.2.7\\n\\nTHREE PERSON CARRY AND STRETCHER LIFT\\n\\n1. Each person kneels on the same knee nearest the victim\\'s feet.\\n\\n2. On the command of the person at the head, the rescuers lift the victim up and rest the victim on their knees.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf the patient is being placed on a low stretcher or litter basket: On the command of the person at the head, the patient is placed down on the litter basket/stretcher.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf the victim is to be carried: At this point, the rescuers will rotate the victim so that the victim is facing the rescuers, resting against the rescuers\\' chests.\\n\\n5. On the command of the person at the head, all the rescuers will stand.\\n\\n6. To walk, all rescuers will start out on the same foot, walking in a line abreast.\\n\\n7. Special care has to be taken in case of suspected backbone or neck injuries (see also section O.6).\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n324\\n\\nO.5\\n\\nSTRETCHERS\\n\\nStretchers are of two patterns viz. “ordinary\" and “telescopic-handled\". In general principle they are similar.\\n\\nA stretcher consists of following parts\\n\\n(cid:1) poles,\\n\\n(cid:1) handles,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\njointed traverses,\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nrunners,\\n\\n(cid:1) bed,\\n\\n(cid:1) pillow-sack, and\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nslings.\\n\\nThe \\'head\\' and \\'foot\\' of a stretcher correspond to the head and feet of the casualty.\\n\\nAt the head of the stretcher may be a canvas overlay (the pillow sack) which can be filled with straw, hay, clothing etc. to form a pillow. The pillow- sack opens at the head and its contents can therefore be adjusted without due disturbance of the casualty.\\n\\nThe traverses are provided with joints for opening or closing the stretcher.\\n\\nThe telescopic-handled pattern is similar but its length can be reduced to 6 feet by sliding the handles underneath the poles. This is of a great value when working in confined space, or when a casualty has to be taken up or down a narrow stair-case with sharp turns.\\n\\nWhen closed, the poles of the stretcher lie close together, the transverse bars being bent inwards, the canvas bed neatly folded on the top of the poles and held in position by the slings, which are laid along with canvas and secured by a strap which is placed transversely at the end of each sling and passed through the large loop of the other, and round the poles and bed.\\n\\nO.5.1\\n\\nLOADING A STRETCHER\\n\\nTwo methods are used to load a patient on a stretcher:\\n\\n(cid:1) blanket lift, and\\n\\n(cid:1) emergency lift.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n325\\n\\nO.5.1.1\\n\\nBLANKET LIFT\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIn the blanket lift, a blanket is placed under the casualty (as described earlier).\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf poles of good length and rigidity are available, roll the blanket over the poles until the poles are pressed to the sides of the casualty.\\n\\nIf poles are not available, the blanket itself is rolled up tightly to the sides of the casualty.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf necessary, broad bandages are places around the body, one at the level of the thigh, another at the level of the shoulders.\\n\\n4. Lift the casualty and place the stretcher exactly under the casualty.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIn case of potential injuries to head, neck, spine or legs, two bearers should support the neck and ankle.\\n\\n6. Lower the casualty on the stretcher.\\n\\n7. Secure the casualty on the stretcher.\\n\\nO.5.1.2\\n\\nEMERGENCY LIFT\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIf no blanket is available, the following method is used: Open the casualty’s coat or bush-coat and roll the free ends firmly close up to the side of the casualty’s body.\\n\\n2. Lift the casualty and put him on the stretcher as described above.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n326\\n\\nO.5.2\\n\\nLIFTING AND LOWERING A STRETCHER\\n\\n1. At the command “Lower Stretcher\", the two or four bearers will stoop, gently lower the stretcher to the ground and rise together.\\n\\n2. At the command “Lift Stretcher\", they will then rise steadily together keeping the stretcher level.\\n\\nO.5.3\\n\\nCARRYING A LOADED STRETCHER\\n\\nDepending on the availability of manpower one can decide whether the stretcher is to be carried by four or two persons.\\n\\nIn case of four helpers, each helper takes one handle of the stretcher and walks on the outside of the stretcher.\\n\\nIn case of two helpers carrying, one helper takes the head side, the other the opposite side. They are positioned between the handles and take the both handles to hold the stretcher. They may decide to use a sling well over their shoulders and on the handles of the stretcher to help them to carry the stretcher.\\n\\nO.5.4\\n\\nLOADING A STRETCHER INTO AN AMBULANCE\\n\\nThe stretcher is lowered with its head one pace from the door of the ambulance. The casualty will be loaded head first. While loading, take side pace to the ambulance raising the stretcher evenly to the level of the berth to be loaded. The front bearers place the runners in the grooves\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n327\\n\\nand then assist the rear bearers to slide the stretcher into its place and secure it. If slings have been used these should be kept with their stretcher.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n328\\n\\nO.6\\n\\nMOVING AND TRANSPORTING A CASUALTY SUSPECTED OF A HEAD, NECK OR SPINAL INJURY\\n\\nTo prevent further injury, a casualty with a suspected head, neck or spinal injury shall be handled with the greatest care.\\n\\nTo transport a casualty suspected of a head, neck or spinal injury:\\n\\n1. Prepare the stretcher; the soft bed of the canvas type of stretcher must be stiffened, preferably by placing short boards across the stretchers, or long ones lengthwise on the canvas if only these are available. If no stretcher is available, a narrow shutter, door or board of at least the same width and length as the patient may be used.\\n\\n2. Cover the stretcher with a folded blanket and then blanket the stretcher.\\n\\nPlace pillows or pads in readiness on the stretcher in a position to support the neck, and small part of the back. Those should be sufficiently large, but not too large, to preserve the normal curves of the spine.\\n\\n3. Whenever the casualty is to be moved or lifted he must not be bent, twisted or over extended. One bearer must apply firm but gentle support to the head and face, so as to prevent neck movement and another bearer must steady and support the lower limbs to prevent trunk movement. This must be continued until the casualty has been placed on the stretcher.\\n\\n4. When the casualty is not already lying on a blanket or rug.\\n\\na. Place the blanket or rug on the ground in line with the casualty, and rolled\\n\\nlengthwise for half its width.\\n\\nb. While the two bearers maintain control of the head and lower limbs, other bearers very carefully turn the casualty on to his side every precaution being taken against movement at the site of the fracture. Place the roller portion of the blanket or rug close to the casualty\\'s back and gently rolls him over the roll until he is lying on his opposite side. Unroll the rolled portion of the blanket or rug gently lowering the casualty on his back so that he lies on the centre of the open blanket or rug. The bearers at the head and at the lower limbs conform to the rolling of the casualty throughout.\\n\\n5. Loading the stretcher.\\n\\nThere are two methods of loading a stretcher- a standard method (when there is a blanket under the casualty), and an emergency method (when there is no blanket under the casualty), in which case the stretcher can be pushed under the casualty for that it will be necessary for the bearer at the feet to keep his legs wide apart to allow the stretcher to be placed between them.\\n\\na. “Blanket lift” is the standard method for loading cases of fractures of the spine\\n\\nwhen there is blanket under the casualty.\\n\\nRoll the two edges of the blanket up against the casualty\\'s side.\\n\\nIf poles of sufficient length and rigidity are available the edges of the blanket should be rolled around them. This will make the lifting of the casualty very much easier.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n329\\n\\nWhile two bearers maintain support of the head and lower limbs, the remaining bearers distribute themselves as required on each side of the casualty facing one another.\\n\\nOn the word of command they raise him by grasping the rolled edges of the blanket and, acting together, carefully and evenly lift him to a sufficient height to enable the stretcher to be pushed underneath him.\\n\\nIf this is for any reason impossible the stretcher should be brought as near to the casualty as circumstances permit and the bearers should move short even side paces until the casualty is directly over the stretcher, when he should be gently and cautiously lowered onto it.\\n\\nEnsure that the pads are in the correct position.\\n\\nb. The “Emergency method” for loading fractures of the spine is used when there\\n\\nis no blanket under the casualty and none is available.\\n\\nOpen out the casualty jacket and roll it firmly so that the rolls are close to each side.\\n\\nPlace the casualty on the stretcher adopting the same procedure as described for the blanket lift method except that the bearers grasp the rolled up jacket and/or the clothing and /or bandage round the casualty\\'s thighs instead of the rolled edges of the blanket. When the clothing is insecure, a broad bandage must be placed round the body just below the shoulder for the bearers to grasp.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIn the case of cervical injuries, place firm supports such as rolled-up blankets or sandbags on each side of the head to steady it.\\n\\n7. Place a folded blanket in the hollow above the heels so as to relieve pressure on them.\\n\\n8. Wrap the casualty.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIf he is to be carried over rough ground, reduce his body movements to a minimum by binding him firmly but not too tightly to the stretcher, with broad bandages. These should be applied round the pelvis, thighs and calves, and round the body and arms, just above the elbows.\\n\\n10. On reaching the shelter, medical facility or hospital, do nothing further until the arrival of medical aid.\\n\\n11. The above method of transportation of spinal injury case is to be used only if hard board is not available.\\n\\nO.6.1.1\\n\\nTRANSPORTING UNCONSCIOUS VICTIMS\\n\\nAfter giving emergency first aid, the victim is to be placed on a large hardboard or inverted “charpai\\'. Secure him on the board and strap him. The head of the victim is to be secured tightly.\\n\\nBreathing unconscious victims are to be placed in the recovery position and transported in that position. They should be observed continuously. If they stop breathing, they should be turned back on their back and CPR is to be started.\\n\\nUnconscious non-breathing casualties are transported whilst lying on their back and whilst CPR is continued to be applied.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n330\\n\\nIf due to certain conditions it is not possible to rescue in horizontal position, a vertical position may be required to be used.\\n\\nTITLE OF CHAPTER\\n\\n331\\n\\nCONTENT OF A FIRST AID KIT\\n\\nSMALL FIRST AID BOX\\n\\n1\\n\\ntube silver sulfadiazine ointment 15 g\\n\\n10\\n\\nband aid strips\\n\\n1\\n\\nroller bandage
